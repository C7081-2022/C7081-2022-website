    "text": "2 Vectors\n\n2.1 The basic vector concept\nVectors can be conceptualized as a list of numerical values (elements) that may be arranged in columns or rows. A formal difference between column and row vectors is the notation for their arrangement, where a vector has n elements, a row vector is a matrix with \\([1 \\times n]\\) elements; a column vector has \\([n \\times 1]\\) elements.\nColumn vector:\n\\(a=\\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 3 \\end{bmatrix}\\)\nRow vector:\n\\(b=\\begin{bmatrix} 2, 1, 3 \\end{bmatrix}\\)\nVectors have a specific order such that:\n\\((2,1,3) \\neq (1,2,3)\\)\nWe can generalize the notation for a vector containing n elements as an n-vector such that:\n\\(a=\\begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\\\ a_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ a_n \\end{bmatrix}\\)\nwhere each element \\(a_i\\) is a numerical value and the vector can be written as \\(a=(a_1,\\dots,a_n)\\).\nWe can represent vectors graphically, e.g. here is an example in R graphing 2 2-vectors.There are some conventions in geometry and math notation here, that are not necessarily the same as the way we store data structures in a programming language…\n\n# imagine two vectors that each contain the x,y coordinates of a point\nvec1 <- c(2,2)\nvec2 <- c(1,-0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVectors in R are always printed in the ‘row format’, regardless of math notation.\n\na <- c(4,2,3)\na\n\n[1] 4 2 3\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Transposing\nTansposing a vector is when a column or row vector is turned into the opposite orientation. The transpose is notated with the symbol \\(\\intercal\\)\nColumn to row format\n\\(\\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\\\ 8 \\\\ 5 \\end{bmatrix} ^ \\intercal = [4, 8, 5]\\)\nRow to column format\n\\([4, 8, 5] ^ \\intercal = \\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\\\ 8 \\\\ 5 \\end{bmatrix}\\)\n\n# transpose in R\na <- c(5,7,6)\n\n# the t() function forces the object as a matrix\nt(a)\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    5    7    6\n\n# multiple transpose, just to demonstrate\nt(t(a))\n\n     [,1]\n[1,]    5\n[2,]    7\n[3,]    6\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Multiplication\nA number \\(b\\) and a vector \\(a\\) can be multiplied together\n\\(b \\times a =\\begin{bmatrix} b \\times a_1 \\\\ b \\times a_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ b \\times a_n \\end{bmatrix}\\)\nThus\n\\(5 \\times \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 5 \\\\ 10 \\\\ 15 \\end{bmatrix}\\)\n\n# vector multiplication in R\na <- c(2,4,5)\nb <- 3\n\na*b\n\n[1]  6 12 15\n\n\nGraphing vector multiplication\n\n# our 2 vectors from before\nvec1 <- c(2,2)\nvec2 <- c(1,-0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Addition\nLet \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) be n-vectors, where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are of the same dimensions.\n\\(a + b = \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\\\ a_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ a_n \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\\\ b_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ b_n \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 + b_1 \\\\ a_2 + b_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ a_n + b_n \\end{bmatrix} = b+a\\)\nWith numbers\n\\(a + b = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 8 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 5 \\\\ 5 \\\\ 13 \\end{bmatrix}\\)\n\n# vector addition in R\na <- c(3, 5, 1)\nb <- c(14, 3, 5)\n\na + b\n\n[1] 17  8  6\n\n\n\n# our 2 vectors from before\nvec1 <- c(2,2)\nvec2 <- c(1,-0.5)\nvec3 <- vec1 + vec2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5 Vector inner product\nThe inner product of a vector is obtained by multiplying two vectors and summing the result (NB this is sometimes called the dot product).\n\\(\\sum a*b = a \\cdot b = a_1b_1 + \\dots + a_nb_n\\)\nwith numbers\n\\(\\sum (\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{bmatrix} \\times \\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 8 \\end{bmatrix}) = \\sum \\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\\\ 6 \\\\ 40 \\end{bmatrix} == 50\\)\n\n# dot product in R\na <- c(1,3,5)\nb <- c(4,2,8)\n\nsum(a * b)\n\n[1] 50\n\n\n\n# alternative syntax for the dot product\na %*% b\n\n     [,1]\n[1,]   50\n\n\n\n\n2.6 Magnitude (aka the “norm”) of a vector\nThere are several ways to measure the “bigness” of a vector, sometimes called the norms. Although we will not go into detail here, there are two types of norm to be aware of. These may seem a little esoteric for our purposes here, but they are used “under the bonnet” for many statistical and machine learning calculations (thus, you may encounter them and should probably be aware of them).\nL1 norm (aka the outer norm) - this is the overall absolute magnitude of vector values\nL2 norm (aka the inner norm) this is the linear (“Euclidean”) distance of the vector from the origin (the zero value in n-dimensional space).\n\nL1 norm\nThe L1 norm is calculated by summing the absolute value of all vector elements.\nTake a vector \\(a = (2, -4, 5)\\)\n\\(||a||_1 = \\sum(|a_1|+ \\dots + |a_n|)\\)\n\\(||a||_1 = (2 + 4 + 5) = 11\\)\n\n\nL2 norm\nThe L2 norm is calculated by taking the square root of the summed values of the squared values of each element of a vector.\nTake a vector \\(b = (-1, 0, 3)\\)\n\\(||b||_2 = \\sqrt(b_1^2+ \\dots + b_n^2)\\)\n\\(||b||_2 = \\sqrt(1 + 0 + 9) = 3.16\\)\n\n# norms in R\na <- c(2, -4, 5)\nb <- c(-1, 0, 3)\n\nsum(abs(a)) # L1\n\n[1] 11\n\nsqrt(sum(b^2)) # L2\n\n[1] 3.162278\n\n# alternative calculation using the norm() function\n# ?norm\n\nnorm(matrix(a), type = \"O\") # L1\n\n[1] 11\n\nnorm(matrix(b), type = \"2\") # L2\n\n[1] 3.162278\n\n\n\n\n\n2.7 Special vectors\nThere are a few special cases of vectors we may encounter (but which are certainly there “doing work” for us), like the 0-vector and the 1-vector. These are simply vectors where all values assume either zero or one, respectively. These are often used in linear models to encode data for matrix calculations (but we will leave it at that for now).\n\n# 0-matrix, n=10\nrep(0, 10)\n\n [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n# 1-matrix, n=8\nrep(1, 8)\n\n[1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n\n\n\n2.8 Orthogonal vectors\nOrthogonal vectors are used in a number of statistical methods, e.g. multivariate statistics like principal component analysis (PCA). Here, orthogonal means perpendicular. We determine orthogonality by taking the inner product of two vectors.\nTake two vectors \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), they are orthogonal if and only if\n\\(a \\perp b \\iff a \\cdot b = 0\\)\n\na <- c(3,-3)\nb <- c(3, 3)\n\nsum(a*b) # yep, a and b are orthogonal!\n\n[1] 0"

    "text": "4 Special topics\n\n4.1 Solving linear equations\nMatrix math is related to math that can be used to solve linear equation systems. This is a very large topic and we will only briefly touch upon it, but it is core in statistics and in machine learning. We can sometimes ignore the details, but awareness of this area of math will likely be beneficial.\nConsider these two linear equations\nEq 1: \\(x_1 + 3x_2 = 7\\)\nEq 2: \\(2x_1 + 4x_2 = 10\\)\nWe can write this “system” of equations in matrix form, from which is derived the notation for statistical linear models. Let’s define the matrices \\(A\\), \\(x\\) and \\(b\\) as:\n\\(\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 \\\\ 2 & 4 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 7 \\\\ 10 \\end{bmatrix}\\), i.e. \\(Ax = b\\)\nBecause \\(A^{-1}A = I\\) and \\(Ix=x\\):\n\\(x = A^{-1}b = \\begin{bmatrix} -2 & 1.5 \\\\ 1 & -0.5 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 7 \\\\ 10 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix}\\)\nThis way of thinking is the foundation of the linear model and we can exploit it to isolate and “solve” for the x values. E.g. we can isolate and solve for \\(x_2\\) as:\nEq 1 (rerarranged): \\(x_2 = \\frac{7}{3}-\\frac{1}{3}x_1\\)\nEq 2 (rerarranged): \\(x_2 = \\frac{10}{4}-\\frac{2}{4}x_1\\)\n\\(x_2 = \\frac{7}{3}-\\frac{1}{3}x_1\\)\n\\(x_2 = \\frac{10}{4}-\\frac{2}{4}x_1\\)\nNow we can graphically represent these equations, which are two lines and which demonstrate the solutions\n\nplot(x=NULL, y=NULL,\n     xlim = c(-1,3), ylim = c(-1,3),\n     pch = 16, \n     xlab=expression('x'[1]), \n     ylab=expression('x'[2]))\nabline(h=c(-1:3),v=c(-1:3),\n       lty=2, col='green3')\nabline(h=0, v=0, lwd=2)\n\nabline(a=7/3, b=-1/3, col=\"red\", lwd=2)\nabline(a=10/4, b=-2/4, col=\"red\", lwd=2)\n\n\n\n\nThe lines represent the solved equations above, and it can be seen that they cross at a single point, the solutions for \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\), \\(x_1 = 1\\) and \\(x_2=2\\), respectively.\n\nA <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4), ncol = 2)\nb <- c(7, 10)\n(x <- solve(A) %*% b)\n\n     [,1]\n[1,]    1\n[2,]    2\n\n\nWhile in this example we see exactly 1 solution, there are several possibilities in general:\n\nExactly one solution – when the lines intersect in one point\nNo solutions – when the lines are parallel but not identical\nInfinitely many solutions – when the lines coincide.\n\n\n\n4.2 Matrix equalities\nHere are a few additional properties of matrices\n\\((A + B)^\\intercal = A^\\intercal + B^\\intercal\\)\n\\((AB)^\\intercal = B^\\intercal A^\\intercal\\)\n\\(A(B + C) = AB + AC\\)\n\\(AB = AC \\not\\Rightarrow B = C\\)\n\\(AB \\neq BA\\) (in general)\n\\(AI = IA = A\\)\nIf \\(\\alpha\\) is a number then \\(\\alpha AB = A(\\alpha B)\\)\n\n\n4.3 Least squares\nConsider the following paired values\n\ndf <- data.frame(x=c(1,2,3,4,5),\n                 y=c(3.7, 4.2,4.9,5.7,6.0))\ndf\n\n  x   y\n1 1 3.7\n2 2 4.2\n3 3 4.9\n4 4 5.7\n5 5 6.0\n\n\nWe can plot these values and note that the relationship is approvimately linear (i.e., a straight line can be drawn that comes close to all the values)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can notate the linear relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) with\n\\(y_i = \\beta_0 +\\beta_1x_i\\) for \\(i = 1, \\dots, 5\\)\nThis can be written in matrix form\n\\(y = \\begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_5 \\end{bmatrix} \\approx \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & x_1 \\\\ 1 & x_2 \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\1 & x_5 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\beta_0 \\\\ \\beta_1\\end{bmatrix} = \\mathbf{X \\beta}\\)\nGiven that we have vectors \\(y\\) and \\(x\\), how can we find the vector \\(\\mathbf{\\beta}\\) to satisfy this equality such that \\(y=X \\beta\\)?\nActually, the answer is no because this would require the points to lie on an exactly straight line! However, it may be useful to find an estimate of \\(\\beta\\) such that \\(\\mathbf{X \\beta}\\) is “as close to \\(y\\) as possible”. Let’s call this estimate \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\)\nTo do this we would like to find \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) that minimizes the equation\n\\(e=y- \\mathbf{X \\beta}\\)\nThe solution to this problem is the basis of linear regression and other linear statistical models:\n\\(\\hat{\\beta} = (X^\\intercal X)^{-1} X^\\intercal y\\)\n\ny <- c(3.7, 4.2,4.9,5.7,6.0)\nx <- c(1,2,3,4,5)\nX <- matrix(c(rep(1,5), x), ncol=2, byrow=F)\ncolnames(X) <- c('','x')\n\ny\n\n[1] 3.7 4.2 4.9 5.7 6.0\n\nX\n\n       x\n[1,] 1 1\n[2,] 1 2\n[3,] 1 3\n[4,] 1 4\n[5,] 1 5\n\n# this solves \"Beta hat\"\n# NB, the intercept and slope coeeficients for linear regression!\n(beta.hat <- solve(t(X) %*% X) %*% t(X) %*% y)\n\n  [,1]\n  3.07\nx 0.61"

    "text": "We use the {e1071} library in R to demonstrate the support vector classifier and the SVM. Another option is the {LiblineaR} library, which is useful for very large linear problems.\n\n\nThe {e1071} library contains implementations for a number of statistical learning methods. In particular, the svm() function can be used to fit a support vector classifier when the argument kernel = \"linear\" is used. A cost argument allows us to specify the cost of a violation to the margin. When the cost argument is small, then the margins will be wide and many support vectors will be on the margin or will violate the margin. When the cost argument is large, then the margins will be narrow and there will be few support vectors on the margin or violating the margin.\n\n\n\nWe now use the svm() function to fit the support vector classifier for a given value of the cost parameter. Here we demonstrate the use of this function on a two-dimensional example so that we can plot the resulting decision boundary. We begin by generating the observations, which belong to two classes, and checking whether the classes are linearly separable.\n\nset.seed(1)\nx <- matrix(rnorm(20 * 2), ncol = 2)\ny <- c( rep (-1, 10) , rep (1 , 10) )\nx[y == 1, ] <- x[ y == 1, ] + 1\nplot(x, col = (3 - y), pch=16)\n\n\n\n\nThey are not (i.e. you cannot separate the classes by drawing a straight line between them). Next, we fit the support vector classifier. Note that in order for the svm() function to perform classification (as opposed to SVM-based regression), we must encode the response as a factor variable. We now create a data frame with the response coded as a factor.\n\ndat <- data.frame(x = x, y = as.factor(y)) \nlibrary(e1071)\nsvmfit <- svm(y ~ ., data = dat, kernel = \"linear\", \n              cost = 10 , scale = FALSE )\n\nThe argument scale = FALSE tells the svm() function not to scale each feature to have mean zero or standard deviation one; depending on the application, one might prefer to use scale = TRUE.\nWe can now plot the support vector classifier obtained:\n\nplot(svmfit, dat) # first peek, not great\n\n\n\n\nNote that the two arguments to the SVM plot() function are the output of the call to svm(), as well as the data used in the call to svm(). The region of feature space that will be assigned to the 1 class is shown in light yellow, and the region that will be assigned to the +1 class is shown in red. The decision boundary between the two classes is linear (because we used the argument kernel = \"linear\"), though due to the way in which the plotting function is implemented in this library the decision boundary looks somewhat jagged in the plot. (Note that here the second feature is plotted on the x-axis and the first feature is plotted on the y-axis, in contrast to the behavior of the usual plot() function in R.) The support vectors are plotted as crosses and the remaining observations are plotted as circles; we see here that there are seven support vectors. We can determine their identities as follows:\n\nsvmfit$index\n\n[1]  1  2  5  7 14 16 17\n\n\nWe can obtain some basic information about the support vector classifier fit using the summary() command:\n\nsummary(svmfit)\n\n\nCall:\nsvm(formula = y ~ ., data = dat, kernel = \"linear\", cost = 10, scale = FALSE)\n\n\nParameters:\n   SVM-Type:  C-classification \n SVM-Kernel:  linear \n       cost:  10 \n\nNumber of Support Vectors:  7\n\n ( 4 3 )\n\n\nNumber of Classes:  2 \n\nLevels: \n -1 1\n\n\nThis tells us, for instance, that a linear kernel was used with cost = 10, and that there were seven support vectors, four in one class and three in the other.\nWhat if we instead used a smaller value of the cost parameter?\n\nsvmfit <- svm(y ~ ., data = dat, kernel = \"linear\",\n              cost = 0.1 , scale = FALSE )\nplot(svmfit, dat) \n\n\n\nsvmfit$index\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  7  9 10 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 20\n\n\nNow that a smaller value of the cost parameter is being used, we obtain a larger number of support vectors, because the margin is now wider. Unfortunately, the svm() function does not explicitly output the coefficients of the linear decision boundary obtained when the support vector classifier is fit, nor does it output the width of the margin.\n\n\n\nThe {e1071} library includes a built-in function, tune(), to perform cross- validation. By default, tune() performs ten-fold cross-validation on a set of models of interest. In order to use this function, we pass in relevant information about the set of models that are under consideration. The following command indicates that we want to compare SVMs with a linear kernel, using a range of values of the cost parameter.\n\nset.seed(1)\ntune.out <- tune(svm, y ~ ., data = dat , kernel = \"linear\",\n                 ranges = list(cost = c(0.001, 0.01, 0.1,\n                                        1, 5, 10, 100)))\n\nWe can easily access the cross-validation errors for each of these models using the summary() command:\n\nsummary(tune.out)\n\n\nParameter tuning of 'svm':\n\n- sampling method: 10-fold cross validation \n\n- best parameters:\n cost\n  0.1\n\n- best performance: 0.05 \n\n- Detailed performance results:\n   cost error dispersion\n1 1e-03  0.55  0.4377975\n2 1e-02  0.55  0.4377975\n3 1e-01  0.05  0.1581139\n4 1e+00  0.15  0.2415229\n5 5e+00  0.15  0.2415229\n6 1e+01  0.15  0.2415229\n7 1e+02  0.15  0.2415229\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that cost = 0.1 (1e-01) results in the lowest cross-validation error rate. The tune() function stores the best model obtained, which can be accessed as follows:\n\nbestmod <- tune.out$best.model\nsummary(bestmod) \n\n\nCall:\nbest.tune(method = svm, train.x = y ~ ., data = dat, ranges = list(cost = c(0.001, \n    0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 100)), kernel = \"linear\")\n\n\nParameters:\n   SVM-Type:  C-classification \n SVM-Kernel:  linear \n       cost:  0.1 \n\nNumber of Support Vectors:  16\n\n ( 8 8 )\n\n\nNumber of Classes:  2 \n\nLevels: \n -1 1\n\n\n\n\n\nThe predict() function can be used to predict the class label on a set of test observations, at any given value of the cost parameter. We begin by generating a test data set.\n\nxtest <- matrix(rnorm(20 * 2), ncol = 2)\nytest <- sample(c(-1, 1), 20, rep = TRUE)\nxtest[ ytest == 1, ] <- xtest[ytest == 1, ] + 1\ntestdat <- data.frame(x = xtest, y = as.factor(ytest))\n\nNow we predict the class labels of these test observations. Here we use the best model obtained through cross-validation in order to make predictions.\n\nypred <- predict(bestmod, testdat)\n\n#our own confusion matrix\ntable(predict = ypred, truth = testdat$y)  #not bad\n\n       truth\npredict -1 1\n     -1  9 1\n     1   2 8\n\n\nThus, with this value of cost, 17 of the test observations are correctly classified. What if we had instead used cost = 0.01?\n\nsvmfit <- svm(y ~ ., data = dat, kernel = \"linear\",\n              cost = .01, scale = FALSE)\nypred <- predict(svmfit, testdat)\n\ntable(predict = ypred, truth = testdat$y) # not as good\n\n       truth\npredict -1  1\n     -1 11  6\n     1   0  3\n\n\nIn this case three additional observations are misclassified.\n\n\n\nNow consider a situation in which the two classes are linearly separable. Then we can find a separating hyperplane using the svm() function. We first further separate the two classes in our simulated data so that they are linearly separable:\n\nx[y == 1, ] <- x[y == 1, ] + 0.5\nplot (x, col = (y + 5) / 2, pch = 16)\n\n\n\n\nNow the observations are just barely linearly separable. We fit the support vector classifier and plot the resulting hyperplane, using a very large value of cost so that no observations are misclassified.\n\ndat <- data.frame(x = x, y = as.factor(y)) \nsvmfit <- svm(y ~ ., data = dat, kernel = \"linear\", cost = 1e5 )\nsummary(svmfit) \n\n\nCall:\nsvm(formula = y ~ ., data = dat, kernel = \"linear\", cost = 1e+05)\n\n\nParameters:\n   SVM-Type:  C-classification \n SVM-Kernel:  linear \n       cost:  1e+05 \n\nNumber of Support Vectors:  3\n\n ( 1 2 )\n\n\nNumber of Classes:  2 \n\nLevels: \n -1 1\n\nplot(svmfit, dat) \n\n\n\n\nNo training errors were made and only three support vectors were used. However, we can see from the figure that the margin is very narrow (because the observations that are not support vectors, indicated as circles, are very close to the decision boundary). It seems likely that this model will perform poorly on test data. We now try a smaller value of cost:\n\nsvmfit <- svm(y ~ ., data = dat, kernel = \"linear\", cost = 1)\nsummary(svmfit) \n\n\nCall:\nsvm(formula = y ~ ., data = dat, kernel = \"linear\", cost = 1)\n\n\nParameters:\n   SVM-Type:  C-classification \n SVM-Kernel:  linear \n       cost:  1 \n\nNumber of Support Vectors:  7\n\n ( 4 3 )\n\n\nNumber of Classes:  2 \n\nLevels: \n -1 1\n\nplot(svmfit, dat) \n\n\n\n\nUsing cost = 1, we misclassify a training observation, but we also obtain a much wider margin and make use of seven support vectors. It seems likely that this model will perform better on test data than the model with cost = 1e5."

In the former case we also use the degree argument to specify a degree for the polynomial kernel (the degree of “bendiness” in the separator), and in the latter case we use gamma to specify a value of \\(\\gamma\\) for the radial basis kernel.

We first write a short function to plot an ROC curve given a vector containing a numerical score for each observation, pred, and a vector containing the class label for each observation, truth.\n\nlibrary(ROCR)\n\nWarning: package 'ROCR' was built under R version 4.1.3\n\n# make function we will use below\nrocplot <- function(pred, truth , ...){\n  predob <- prediction (pred, truth)\n  perf <- performance (predob , \"tpr\", \"fpr\")\n  plot (perf, ...)\n  }\n\nSVMs and support vector classifiers output class labels for each observation. However, it is also possible to obtain fitted values for each observation, which are the numerical scores used to obtain the class labels. For instance, in the case of a support vector classifier, the fitted value for an observation \\(X = (X_1, X_2,. .., X_p)^T\\) takes the form \\(\\hat\\beta_0 + \\hat\\beta_1X_1 + \\hat\\beta_2X_2 + + \\hat\\beta_pX_p\\).\nIn essence, the sign of the fitted value determines on which side of the decision boundary the observation lies. Therefore, the relationship between the fitted value and the class prediction for a given observation is simple: if the fitted value exceeds zero then the observation is assigned to one class, and if it is less than zero then it is assigned to the other. In order to obtain the fitted values for a given SVM model fit, we use decision.values = TRUE when fitting svm(). Then the predict() function will output the fitted values.\n\nsvmfit.opt <- svm(y ~ ., data = dat[train, ], \n                  kernel = \"radial\", gamma = 2, cost = 1, \n                  decision.values = TRUE)\n\n# another utility function\nfitted <- attributes(\n  predict(svmfit.opt, dat[train, ], decision.values = TRUE)\n  )$decision.values\n\nNow we can produce the ROC plot. Note we use the negative of the fitted values so that negative values correspond to class 1 and positive values to class 2.\n\npar(mfrow = c(1, 1))\n\n# gamma = 2\nrocplot(-fitted, dat[train, \"y\"], main = \"Training Data\")\n\nsvmfit.flex <- svm(y ~ ., data = dat [train, ], \n                   kernel = \"radial\", gamma = 50 , \n                   cost = 1, decision.values = T)\n\nfitted <- attributes(\n  predict(svmfit.flex, dat[train, ], decision.values = T)\n  )$decision.values\n\n# gamma = 50\nrocplot(-fitted, dat[train, \"y\"], add = T, col = \"red\")\n\nlegend(x = .6, y=.8,\n       legend = c('gamma = 2', 'gamma = 50'),\n       bty = 'n', col = c(1,2), lty = 1)\n\n\n\n\nThe SVM appears to be producing accurate predictionsmade much better here by increasing \\(\\gamma\\) to produce a more flexible fit and generate further improvements in accuracy.\n\nTrain & TEST\nHowever, these ROC curves are all on the training data. We are really more interested in the level of prediction accuracy on the test data. When we compute the ROC curves on the test data, the model with \\(\\gamma\\) = 2 appears to provide the most accurate results.\n\nfitted <- attributes(\n  predict(svmfit.opt, dat[-train, ], decision.values = T)\n  )$decision.values\n\nrocplot(-fitted, dat[-train , \"y\"], main = \"Test Data\")\n\nfitted <- attributes(\n  predict(svmfit.flex, dat[-train, ], decision.values = T)\n  )$decision.values\n\nrocplot(-fitted, dat[-train , \"y\"], add = T, col = \"red\")\n\nlegend(x = .6, y=.8,\n       legend = c('gamma = 2', 'gamma = 50'),\n       bty = 'n', col = c(1,2), lty = 1)"

Show that in this setting, a support vector machine with a polynomial kernel (with degree greater than 1) or a radial kernel will outperform a support vector classifier on the training data. Which technique performs best on the test data? Make plots and report training and test error rates in order to back up your assertions.\n\n\n\nExercise 2\nWe have seen that we can fit an SVM with a non-linear kernel in order to perform classification using a non-linear decision boundary. We will now see that we can also obtain a non-linear decision boundary by performing logistic regression using non-linear transformations of the features.\n\n2.1\nGenerate a data set with n = 500 and p = 2, such that the observations belong to two classes with a quadratic decision boundary between them. For instance, you can do this as follows:\n\n# Although it is beyond what is possible in this lab,\n# the practice of simulating data like this is \n# hugely powerful and useful\nx1 <- runif(500) - 0.5\nx2 <- runif(500) - 0.5\ny <- 1 * (x1^2 - x2^2 > 0)\n\n\n\n2.2\nPlot the observations, colored according to their class labels. Your plot should display \\(X_1\\) on the x-axis, and \\(X_2\\) on the y-axis.\n\n\n2.3\nFit a logistic regression model to the data, using \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) as predictors.\n\n\n2.4\nApply this model to the training data in order to obtain a predicted class label for each training observation. Plot the observations, colored according to the predicted class labels. The decision boundary should be linear.\n\n\n2.5\nNow fit a logistic regression model to the data using non-linear functions of \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) as predictors (e.g. \\(X^2\\), \\(X_1 \\times X_2\\), log(\\(X_2\\)), and so forth).\n\n\n2.6\nApply this model to the training data in order to obtain a predicted class label for each training observation. Plot the observations, colored according to the predicted class labels. The decision boundary should be obviously non-linear. If it is not, then repeat (2.1)-(2.5) to see if you can come up with an example in which the predicted class labels are obviously non-linear.\n\n\n2.7\nFit a support vector classifier to the data with \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) as predictors. Obtain a class prediction for each training observation. Plot the observations, colored according to the predicted class labels.\n\n\n2.8\nFit a SVM using a non-linear kernel to the data. Obtain a class prediction for each training observation. Plot the observations, colored according to the predicted class labels.\n\n\n2.9\nComment on your results."

It turns out that these two measures are almost equivalent: if each observation has been centered to have mean zero and standard deviation one, and if we let \\(r_{ij}\\) denote the correlation between the ith and jth observations, then the quantity \\(1-r_{ij}\\) is proportional to the squared Euclidean distance between the \\(i^{th}\\) and \\(j^{th}\\) observations.\nOn the USArrests data, can you explore the data to show that this proportionality holds?\nHint: The Euclidean distance can be calculated using the dist() function, and correlations can be calculated using the cor() function.\n\n\nExercise 2\nWe also saw that the PVE can be obtained using the sdev output of the prcomp() function.\nOn the USArrests data, calculate PVE by using the sdev output of the prcomp() function\n\n\nExercise 3\nConsider the USArrests data. We will now perform hierarchical clustering on the states.\n\n3.1\nUsing hierarchical clustering with complete linkage and Euclidean distance, cluster the states.\n\n\n3.2\nCut the dendrogram at a height that results in three distinct clusters.

The type=\"response\" option tells R to output probabilities of the form \\(P(Y = 1|X)\\) (the probability that Y = the value of ‘1’, given some value of X), as opposed to other information such as the logit. If no data set is supplied to the predict() function, then the probabilities are computed for the training data that was used to ﬁt the logistic regression model. Here we can print the ﬁrst ten probabilities. We know that these values correspond to the probability of the market going up, rather than down, because the contrasts() function indicates that R has created a dummy variable with a 1 for Up.\n\nglm.probs <- predict(glm.fit, type = \"response\")\nglm.probs[1:10]\n\n        1         2         3         4         5         6         7         8 \n0.5070841 0.4814679 0.4811388 0.5152224 0.5107812 0.5069565 0.4926509 0.5092292 \n        9        10 \n0.5176135 0.4888378 \n\ncontrasts(Direction)\n\n     Up\nDown  0\nUp    1\n\n\nIn order to make a prediction as to whether the market will go up or down on a particular day, we can convert these predicted probabilities into class labels, Up or Down. The following two commands create a vector of class predictions based on whether the predicted probability of a market increase is greater than or less than 0.5.\n\nglm.pred <- rep(\"Down\", 1250) # make vector\nglm.pred[glm.probs > .5] <- \"Up\" # add Up values\n\n\n\n\nThe ﬁrst command creates a vector of 1,250 Down elements. The second line transforms to Up all of the elements for which the predicted probability of a market increase exceeds 0.5. Given these predictions, the table() function can be used to produce a confusion matrix in order to determine how many observations were correctly or incorrectly classiﬁed.\n\ntable(glm.pred, Direction) # confusion matrix\n\n        Direction\nglm.pred Down  Up\n    Down  145 141\n    Up    457 507\n\n(507+145)/1250 # proportion correct predictions out of 50/50 (like flipping a coin)\n\n[1] 0.5216\n\nmean(glm.pred == Direction) # fancier programmatic calculation\n\n[1] 0.5216\n\n\nThe diagonal elements of the confusion matrix indicate correct predictions, while the off-diagonals represent incorrect predictions. Hence our model correctly predicted that the market would go up on 507 days and that it would go down on 145 days, for a total of 507 + 145 = 652 correct predictions. The mean() function can be used to compute the fraction of days for which the prediction was correct. In this case, logistic regression correctly predicted the movement of the market 52.2% of the time.\nAt ﬁrst glance, it appears that the logistic regression model is working a little better than random guessing. However, this result is misleading because we trained and tested the model on the same set of 1,250 observations. In other words, \\(100-52.2 = 47.8\\)% is the training error rate. As we have seen previously, the training error rate is often overly optimistic because it tends to underestimate the test error rate. In order to better assess the accuracy of the logistic regression model in this setting, we can ﬁt the model using part of the data, and then examine how well it predicts the held out data. This will yield a more realistic error rate, in the sense that in practice we will be interested in our model’s performance not on the data that we used to ﬁt the model, but rather on days in the future for which the market’s movements are unknown.\nTo implement this strategy, we will ﬁrst create a vector corresponding to the observations from 2001 through 2004. We will then use this vector to create a “held out” data set of observations from 2005.\n\ntrain <- (Year < 2005)\nSmarket.2005 <- Smarket[!train, ]\ndim(Smarket.2005)\n\n[1] 252   9\n\nDirection.2005 <- Direction[!train]\n\n\n\n\nThe object train is a vector of 1,250 elements, corresponding to the observations in our data set. The elements of the vector that correspond to observations that occurred before 2005 are set to TRUE, whereas those that correspond to observations in 2005 are set to FALSE. The object train is a Boolean vector, since its elements are TRUE and FALSE. Boolean vectors can be used to obtain a subset of the rows or columns of a matrix. For instance, the command Smarket[train, ] would pick out a submatrix of the stock market data set, corresponding only to the dates before 2005, since those are the ones for which the elements of train are TRUE. The ! symbol can be used to reverse all of the elements of a Boolean vector.\nThat is, !train is a vector similar to train, except that the elements that are TRUE in train get swapped to FALSE in !train, and the elements that are FALSE in train get swapped to TRUE in !train. Therefore, Smarket[!train,] yields a submatrix of the stock market data containing only the observations for which train is FALSE. That is, the observations with dates in 2005. The output above indicates that there are 252 such observations.\n\n\n\nWe now ﬁt a logistic regression model using only the subset of the observations that correspond to dates before 2005, using the subset argument. We then obtain predicted probabilities of the stock market going up for each of the days in our test set. That is, for the days in 2005.\n\nglm.fit <- glm(Direction ~ Lag1 + Lag2 + Lag3 + Lag4 + Lag5 + Volume,\n               data = Smarket, family = binomial, subset = train )\nglm.probs <- predict(glm.fit, Smarket.2005, type = \"response\")\n\nNotice that we have trained and tested our model on two completely separate data sets: training was performed using only the dates before 2005, and testing was performed using only the dates in 2005. This is the whole point.\nFinally, we compute the predictions for 2005 and compare them to the actual movements of the market over that time period.\n\nglm.pred <- rep(\"Down\", 252)\nglm.pred[glm.probs > .5] <- \"Up\"\ntable(glm.pred, Direction.2005)\n\n        Direction.2005\nglm.pred Down Up\n    Down   77 97\n    Up     34 44\n\nmean(glm.pred == Direction.2005)\n\n[1] 0.4801587\n\nmean(glm.pred != Direction.2005)\n\n[1] 0.5198413\n\n\nThe != notation means not equal to, and so the last command computes the test set error rate. The results are rather disappointing: the test error rate is 52%, which is worse than random guessing! Of course this result is not all that surprising, given that one would not generally expect to be able to use previous days’ returns to predict future market performance. (After all, if it were easy to do so economics would not be a field of study)"

Perhaps by removing the variables that appear not to be helpful in predicting Direction, we can obtain a more eﬀective model. After all, using predictors that have no relationship with the response tends to cause a deterioration in the test error rate (since such predictors cause an increase in variance without a corresponding decrease in bias), and so removing such predictors may in turn yield an improvement. Below we will refit the logistic regression using just Lag1 and Lag2, which seemed to have the highest predictive power in the original logistic regression model.\n\nglm.fit <- glm (Direction ~ Lag1 + Lag2, data = Smarket, \n                  family = binomial, subset = train)\nglm.probs <- predict(glm.fit, Smarket.2005, type = \"response\")\nglm.pred <- rep (\"Down\" ,252)\nglm.pred[glm.probs > .5] = \"Up\"\ntable(glm.pred, Direction.2005)\n\n        Direction.2005\nglm.pred Down  Up\n    Down   35  35\n    Up     76 106\n\nmean(glm.pred == Direction.2005)\n\n[1] 0.5595238\n\n106/(106+76) \n\n[1] 0.5824176\n\n\nNow the results appear to be a little better: 56% of the daily movements have been correctly predicted. It is worth noting that in this case, a much simpler strategy of predicting that the market will increase every day will also be correct 56% of the time! Hence, in terms of overall error rate, the logistic regression method is no better than the naïve approach. However, the confusion matrix shows that on days when logistic regression predicts an increase in the market, it has a 58% accuracy rate. This suggests a possible trading strategy of buying on days when the model predicts an increasing market, and avoiding trades on days when a decrease is predicted. Of course one would need to investigate more carefully whether this small improvement was real or just due to random chance.\n\nMore predict()\nSuppose that we want to predict the returns associated with particular values of Lag1 and Lag2. In particular, we want to predict Direction on a day when Lag1 and Lag2 equal 1.2 and 1.1, respectively, and on a day when they equal 1.5 and −0.8. We do this using the predict() function.\n\npredict(glm.fit, \n        newdata = data.frame(Lag1 = c(1.2, 1.5),\n                                      Lag2 =c(1.1, -0.8)), \n        type = \"response\")\n\n        1         2 \n0.4791462 0.4960939"

It also provides the group means; these are the average of each predictor within each class, and are used by LDA as estimates of \\(μ_k\\). These suggest that there is a tendency for the previous 2 days’ returns to be negative on days when the market increases, and a tendency for the previous days’ returns to be positive on days when the market declines. The coefficients of linear discriminants output provides the linear combination of Lag1 and Lag2 that are used to form the LDA decision rule.\nIn other words, these are the multipliers of the elements of X = x in (4.19). If −0.642 × Lag1− 0.514 × Lag2 is large, then the LDA classiﬁer will predict a market increase, and if it is small, then the LDA classifier will predict a market decline. The plot() function produces plots of the linear discriminants, obtained by computing 0.642 X Lag1 - 0.514 Lag2 for each of the training observations.\nThe predict() function returns a list with three elements.

The function requires four inputs.\n\nA matrix containing the predictors associated with the training data, labeled train.X below.\nA matrix containing the predictors associated with the data for which we wish to make predictions, labeled test.X below.\nA vector containing the class labels for the training observations, labeled train.Direction below.\nA value for K, the number of nearest neighbors to be used by the classifier.\n\nWe will use the cbind() function, short for column bind, to bind the Lag1 and Lag2 variables together into two matrices, one for the training set and the other for the test set.\n\nlibrary( class)\ntrain.X <- cbind(Lag1, Lag2)[train, ]\ntest.X <- cbind(Lag1, Lag2)[!train, ]\ntrain.Direction <- Direction[train]\n\nNow the knn() function can be used to predict the market’s movement for the dates in 2005. We set a random seed before we apply knn() because if several observations are tied as nearest neighbors, then R will randomly break the tie. Therefore, a seed must be set in order to ensure reproducibility of results.\n\nset.seed(1)\nlibrary(class)\nknn.pred <- knn(train.X, test.X, train.Direction, k = 1)\ntable(knn.pred, Direction.2005)\n\n        Direction.2005\nknn.pred Down Up\n    Down   43 58\n    Up     68 83\n\n(83+43) /252\n\n[1] 0.5\n\n\nThe results using K = 1 are not very good, since only 50% of the observa- tions are correctly predicted.

Any variables that are on a large scale will have a much larger eﬀect on the distance between the observations, and hence on the KNN classiﬁer, than variables that are on a small scale. For instance, imagine a data set that contains two variables, salary and age (measured in dollars and years, respectively). As far as KNN is concerned, a difference of $1,000 in salary is enormous compared to a difference of 50 years in age. Consequently, salary will drive the KNN classification results, and age will have almost no effect. This is contrary to our intuition that a salary difference of $1,000 is quite small compared to an age difference of 50 years. Furthermore, the importance of scale to the KNN classiﬁer leads to another issue: if we measured salary in British Pounds, or if we measured age in minutes, then we’d get quite diﬀerent classification results from what we get if these two variables are measured in dollars and years.\n\n\nStandardizing data\nA good way to handle this problem is to standardize the data so that all variables are given a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Then all variables will be on a comparable scale. The scale() function does just this. In standardizing the data, we exclude column 86, because that is the qualitative Purchase variable.\n\nstandardized.X <- scale(Caravan [,-86])\nvar(Caravan[,1])\n\n[1] 165.0378\n\nvar(Caravan[,2])\n\n[1] 0.1647078\n\nvar(standardized.X[,1])\n\n[1] 1\n\nvar(standardized.X[,2])\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nNow every column of standardized.X has a standard deviation of one and a mean of zero.\nWe now split the observations into a test set, containing the ﬁrst 1,000 observations, and a training set, containing the remaining observations. We ﬁt a KNN model on the training data using K = 1, and evaluate its performance on the test data.\n\ntest <- 1:1000\ntrain.X <- standardized.X[-test, ]\ntest.X <- standardized.X[test, ]\ntrain.Y <- Purchase[-test]\ntest.Y <- Purchase[test]\n\nset.seed(1)\nknn.pred <- knn(train.X, test.X, train.Y, k = 1)\nmean(test.Y != knn.pred )\n\n[1] 0.118\n\nmean(test.Y != \"No\")\n\n[1] 0.059\n\n\nThe vector test is numeric, with values from 1 through 1,000. Typing standardized.X[test, ] yields the submatrix of the data containing the observations whose indices range from 1 to 1,000, whereas typing standardized.X[-test, ] yields the submatrix containing the observations whose indices do not range from 1 to 1,000. The KNN error rate on the 1,000 test observations is just under 12%. At ﬁrst glance, this may appear to be fairly good. However, since only 6% of customers purchased insurance, we could get the error rate down to 6% by always predicting No regardless of the values of the predictors!\nSuppose that there is some non-trivial cost to trying to sell insurance to a given individual. For instance, perhaps a salesperson must visit each potential customer. If the company tries to sell insurance to a random selection of customers, then the success rate will be only 6%, which may be far too low given the costs involved. Instead, the company would like to try to sell insurance only to customers who are likely to buy it. So the overall error rate is not of interest. Instead, the fraction of individuals that are correctly predicted to buy insurance is of interest.\nIt turns out that KNN with K = 1 does far better than random guessing among the customers that are predicted to buy insurance. Among 77 such customers, 9, or 11.7%, actually do purchase insurance. This is double the rate that one would obtain from random guessing.\n\ntable(knn.pred, test.Y)\n\n        test.Y\nknn.pred  No Yes\n     No  873  50\n     Yes  68   9\n\n9/(68+9)\n\n[1] 0.1168831\n\n\n\n\nExploring KNN model tuning\nUsing K = 3 (implying there are 3 groupings of customers), the success rate increases to 19%, and with K = 5 (5 groups) the rate is 26.7%. This is over four times the rate that results from random guessing. It appears that KNN is ﬁnding some real patterns in a difficult data set!\n\nknn.pred <- knn(train.X, test.X, train.Y, k = 3)\ntable(knn.pred, test.Y)\n\n        test.Y\nknn.pred  No Yes\n     No  920  54\n     Yes  21   5\n\n5/26\n\n[1] 0.1923077\n\nknn.pred <- knn(train.X, test.X, train.Y, k = 5)\ntable(knn.pred, test.Y)\n\n        test.Y\nknn.pred  No Yes\n     No  930  55\n     Yes  11   4\n\n4/15\n\n[1] 0.2666667\n\n\n\n\nCompare to logistic regression\nAs a comparison, we can also ﬁt a logistic regression model to the data. If we use 0.5 as the predicted probability cut-off for the classifier, then we have a problem: only seven of the test observations are predicted to purchase insurance. Even worse, we are wrong about all of these! However, we are not required to use a cut-off of 0.5. If we instead predict a purchase any time the predicted probability of purchase exceeds 0.25, we get much better results: we predict that 33 people will purchase insurance, and we are correct for about 33% of these people. This is over ﬁve times better than random guessing!\n\nglm.fit <- glm(Purchase ~ ., data = Caravan, family = binomial,\n               subset = -test)\n\nWarning: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred\n\nglm.probs <- predict(glm.fit, Caravan[test, ], type = \"response\")\nglm.pred <- rep(\"No\" , 1000)\nglm.pred [glm.probs > .5]= \"Yes\"\ntable(glm.pred, test.Y)\n\n        test.Y\nglm.pred  No Yes\n     No  934  59\n     Yes   7   0\n\nglm.pred <- rep(\"No\", 1000)\nglm.pred[glm.probs > .25] <- \"Yes\"\ntable(glm.pred, test.Y)\n\n        test.Y\nglm.pred  No Yes\n     No  919  48\n     Yes  22  11\n\n11/(22+11 )\n\n[1] 0.3333333"

The glm() function ﬁts generalized linear models, a class of models that includes logistic regression, and allows us to model data that do not adhere to the Gaussian assumption. The syntax of the glm() function is similar to that of lm(), except that we must pass in the argument family=binomial in order to tell R to run a logistic regression rather than some other type of generalized linear model.\n\nglm.fit <- glm(Direction ~ Lag1 + Lag2 + Lag3 + Lag4 + Lag5 + Volume,\n               data = Smarket, \n               family = binomial )\nsummary(glm.fit)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = Direction ~ Lag1 + Lag2 + Lag3 + Lag4 + Lag5 + \n    Volume, family = binomial, data = Smarket)\n\nDeviance Residuals: \n   Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max  \n-1.446  -1.203   1.065   1.145   1.326  \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

The type=\"response\" option tells R to output probabilities of the form \\(P(Y = 1|X)\\) (the probability that Y = the value of ‘1’, given some value of X), as opposed to other information such as the logit. If no data set is supplied to the predict() function, then the probabilities are computed for the training data that was used to ﬁt the logistic regression model. Here we can print the ﬁrst ten probabilities. We know that these values correspond to the probability of the market going up, rather than down, because the contrasts() function indicates that R has created a dummy variable with a 1 for Up.\n\nglm.probs <- predict(glm.fit, type = \"response\")\nglm.probs[1:10]\n\n        1         2         3         4         5         6         7         8 \n0.5070841 0.4814679 0.4811388 0.5152224 0.5107812 0.5069565 0.4926509 0.5092292 \n        9        10 \n0.5176135 0.4888378 \n\ncontrasts(Direction)\n\n     Up\nDown  0\nUp    1\n\n\nIn order to make a prediction as to whether the market will go up or down on a particular day, we can convert these predicted probabilities into class labels, Up or Down. The following two commands create a vector of class predictions based on whether the predicted probability of a market increase is greater than or less than 0.5.\n\nglm.pred <- rep(\"Down\", 1250) # make vector\nglm.pred[glm.probs > .5] <- \"Up\" # add Up values\n\n\n\n\nThe ﬁrst command creates a vector of 1,250 Down elements. The second line transforms to Up all of the elements for which the predicted probability of a market increase exceeds 0.5. Given these predictions, the table() function can be used to produce a confusion matrix in order to determine how many observations were correctly or incorrectly classiﬁed.\n\ntable(glm.pred, Direction) # confusion matrix\n\n        Direction\nglm.pred Down  Up\n    Down  145 141\n    Up    457 507\n\n(507+145)/1250 # proportion correct predictions out of 50/50 (like flipping a coin)\n\n[1] 0.5216\n\nmean(glm.pred == Direction) # fancier programmatic calculation\n\n[1] 0.5216\n\n\nThe diagonal elements of the confusion matrix indicate correct predictions, while the off-diagonals represent incorrect predictions. Hence our model correctly predicted that the market would go up on 507 days and that it would go down on 145 days, for a total of 507 + 145 = 652 correct predictions. The mean() function can be used to compute the fraction of days for which the prediction was correct. In this case, logistic regression correctly predicted the movement of the market 52.2% of the time.\nAt ﬁrst glance, it appears that the logistic regression model is working a little better than random guessing. However, this result is misleading because we trained and tested the model on the same set of 1,250 observations. In other words, \\(100-52.2 = 47.8\\)% is the training error rate. As we have seen previously, the training error rate is often overly optimistic because it tends to underestimate the test error rate. In order to better assess the accuracy of the logistic regression model in this setting, we can ﬁt the model using part of the data, and then examine how well it predicts the held out data. This will yield a more realistic error rate, in the sense that in practice we will be interested in our model’s performance not on the data that we used to ﬁt the model, but rather on days in the future for which the market’s movements are unknown.\nTo implement this strategy, we will ﬁrst create a vector corresponding to the observations from 2001 through 2004. We will then use this vector to create a “held out” data set of observations from 2005.\n\ntrain <- (Year < 2005)\nSmarket.2005 <- Smarket[!train, ]\ndim(Smarket.2005)\n\n[1] 252   9\n\nDirection.2005 <- Direction[!train]\n\n\n\n\nThe object train is a vector of 1,250 elements, corresponding to the observations in our data set. The elements of the vector that correspond to observations that occurred before 2005 are set to TRUE, whereas those that correspond to observations in 2005 are set to FALSE. The object train is a Boolean vector, since its elements are TRUE and FALSE. Boolean vectors can be used to obtain a subset of the rows or columns of a matrix. For instance, the command Smarket[train, ] would pick out a submatrix of the stock market data set, corresponding only to the dates before 2005, since those are the ones for which the elements of train are TRUE. The ! symbol can be used to reverse all of the elements of a Boolean vector.\nThat is, !train is a vector similar to train, except that the elements that are TRUE in train get swapped to FALSE in !train, and the elements that are FALSE in train get swapped to TRUE in !train. Therefore, Smarket[!train,] yields a submatrix of the stock market data containing only the observations for which train is FALSE. That is, the observations with dates in 2005. The output above indicates that there are 252 such observations.\n\n\n\nWe now ﬁt a logistic regression model using only the subset of the observations that correspond to dates before 2005, using the subset argument. We then obtain predicted probabilities of the stock market going up for each of the days in our test set. That is, for the days in 2005.\n\nglm.fit <- glm(Direction ~ Lag1 + Lag2 + Lag3 + Lag4 + Lag5 + Volume,\n               data = Smarket, family = binomial, subset = train )\nglm.probs <- predict(glm.fit, Smarket.2005, type = \"response\")\n\nNotice that we have trained and tested our model on two completely separate data sets: training was performed using only the dates before 2005, and testing was performed using only the dates in 2005. This is the whole point.\nFinally, we compute the predictions for 2005 and compare them to the actual movements of the market over that time period.\n\nglm.pred <- rep(\"Down\", 252)\nglm.pred[glm.probs > .5] <- \"Up\"\ntable(glm.pred, Direction.2005)\n\n        Direction.2005\nglm.pred Down Up\n    Down   77 97\n    Up     34 44\n\nmean(glm.pred == Direction.2005)\n\n[1] 0.4801587\n\nmean(glm.pred != Direction.2005)\n\n[1] 0.5198413\n\n\nThe != notation means not equal to, and so the last command computes the test set error rate. The results are rather disappointing: the test error rate is 52%, which is worse than random guessing! Of course this result is not all that surprising, given that one would not generally expect to be able to use previous days’ returns to predict future market performance. (After all, if it were easy to do so economics would not be a field of study)"

Perhaps by removing the variables that appear not to be helpful in predicting Direction, we can obtain a more eﬀective model. After all, using predictors that have no relationship with the response tends to cause a deterioration in the test error rate (since such predictors cause an increase in variance without a corresponding decrease in bias), and so removing such predictors may in turn yield an improvement. Below we will refit the logistic regression using just Lag1 and Lag2, which seemed to have the highest predictive power in the original logistic regression model.\n\nglm.fit <- glm (Direction ~ Lag1 + Lag2, data = Smarket, \n                  family = binomial, subset = train)\nglm.probs <- predict(glm.fit, Smarket.2005, type = \"response\")\nglm.pred <- rep (\"Down\" ,252)\nglm.pred[glm.probs > .5] = \"Up\"\ntable(glm.pred, Direction.2005)\n\n        Direction.2005\nglm.pred Down  Up\n    Down   35  35\n    Up     76 106\n\nmean(glm.pred == Direction.2005)\n\n[1] 0.5595238\n\n106/(106+76) \n\n[1] 0.5824176\n\n\nNow the results appear to be a little better: 56% of the daily movements have been correctly predicted. It is worth noting that in this case, a much simpler strategy of predicting that the market will increase every day will also be correct 56% of the time! Hence, in terms of overall error rate, the logistic regression method is no better than the naïve approach. However, the confusion matrix shows that on days when logistic regression predicts an increase in the market, it has a 58% accuracy rate. This suggests a possible trading strategy of buying on days when the model predicts an increasing market, and avoiding trades on days when a decrease is predicted. Of course one would need to investigate more carefully whether this small improvement was real or just due to random chance.\n\nMore predict()\nSuppose that we want to predict the returns associated with particular values of Lag1 and Lag2. In particular, we want to predict Direction on a day when Lag1 and Lag2 equal 1.2 and 1.1, respectively, and on a day when they equal 1.5 and −0.8. We do this using the predict() function.\n\npredict(glm.fit, \n        newdata = data.frame(Lag1 = c(1.2, 1.5),\n                                      Lag2 =c(1.1, -0.8)), \n        type = \"response\")\n\n        1         2 \n0.4791462 0.4960939"

In R, we ﬁt a LDA model using the lda() function, which is part of the MASS library. Notice that the syntax for the lda() function is identical to that of lm(), and to that of glm() except for the absence of the family option.

It also provides the group means; these are the average of each predictor within each class, and are used by LDA as estimates of \\(μ_k\\). These suggest that there is a tendency for the previous 2 days’ returns to be negative on days when the market increases, and a tendency for the previous days’ returns to be positive on days when the market declines. The coefficients of linear discriminants output provides the linear combination of Lag1 and Lag2 that are used to form the LDA decision rule.\nIn other words, these are the multipliers of the elements of X = x in (4.19). If −0.642 × Lag1− 0.514 × Lag2 is large, then the LDA classiﬁer will predict a market increase, and if it is small, then the LDA classifier will predict a market decline. The plot() function produces plots of the linear discriminants, obtained by computing 0.642 X Lag1 - 0.514 Lag2 for each of the training observations.\nThe predict() function returns a list with three elements. The ﬁrst element, class, contains LDA’s predictions about the movement of the market. The second element, posterior, is a matrix whose kth column contains the posterior probability that the corresponding observation belongs to the kth class.

This function works rather differently from the other model-fitting functions that we have encountered thus far. Rather than a two-step approach in which we ﬁrst ﬁt the model and then we use the model to make predictions, knn() forms predictions using a single command. The function requires four inputs.\n\nA matrix containing the predictors associated with the training data, labeled train.X below.\nA matrix containing the predictors associated with the data for which we wish to make predictions, labeled test.X below.\nA vector containing the class labels for the training observations, labeled train.Direction below.\nA value for K, the number of nearest neighbors to be used by the classifier.\n\nWe will use the cbind() function, short for column bind, to bind the Lag1 and Lag2 variables together into two matrices, one for the training set and the other for the test set.\n\nlibrary( class)\ntrain.X <- cbind(Lag1, Lag2)[train, ]\ntest.X <- cbind(Lag1, Lag2)[!train, ]\ntrain.Direction <- Direction[train]\n\nNow the knn() function can be used to predict the market’s movement for the dates in 2005. We set a random seed before we apply knn() because if several observations are tied as nearest neighbors, then R will randomly break the tie. Therefore, a seed must be set in order to ensure reproducibility of results.\n\nset.seed(1)\nlibrary(class)\nknn.pred <- knn(train.X, test.X, train.Direction, k = 1)\ntable(knn.pred, Direction.2005)\n\n        Direction.2005\nknn.pred Down Up\n    Down   43 58\n    Up     68 83\n\n(83+43) /252\n\n[1] 0.5\n\n\nThe results using K = 1 are not very good, since only 50% of the observa- tions are correctly predicted. Of course, it may be that K = 1 results in an overly ﬂexible ﬁt to the data. Let’s repeat the analysis using a different K, K = 3.\n\nknn.pred <- knn(train.X, test.X, train.Direction, k = 3)\ntable(knn.pred, Direction.2005)\n\n        Direction.2005\nknn.pred Down Up\n    Down   48 54\n    Up     63 87\n\nmean (knn.pred == Direction.2005)\n\n[1] 0.5357143\n\n\nThe results have improved slightly. But increasing K further turns out to provide no further improvements. It appears that for this data, QDA provides the best results of the methods that we have examined so far.\n\n\nCaravan insurance data\nFinally, we will apply the KNN approach to the Caravan data set, which is part of the {ISLR} library. This data set includes 85 predictors that measure demographic characteristics for 5,822 individuals. The response variable is Purchase, which indicates whether or not a given individual purchases a caravan insurance policy. In this data set, only 6% of people purchased caravan insurance.\n\ndim(Caravan)\n\n[1] 5822   86\n\nattach(Caravan)\nsummary(Purchase) \n\n  No  Yes \n5474  348 \n\n348/5822 # % purchasing insurance\n\n[1] 0.05977327\n\n\nBecause the KNN classiﬁer predicts the class of a given test observation by identifying the observations that are nearest to it, the scale of the variables matters. Any variables that are on a large scale will have a much larger eﬀect on the distance between the observations, and hence on the KNN classiﬁer, than variables that are on a small scale. For instance, imagine a data set that contains two variables, salary and age (measured in dollars and years, respectively). As far as KNN is concerned, a difference of $1,000 in salary is enormous compared to a difference of 50 years in age. Consequently, salary will drive the KNN classification results, and age will have almost no effect. This is contrary to our intuition that a salary difference of $1,000 is quite small compared to an age difference of 50 years. Furthermore, the importance of scale to the KNN classiﬁer leads to another issue: if we measured salary in British Pounds, or if we measured age in minutes, then we’d get quite diﬀerent classification results from what we get if these two variables are measured in dollars and years.\n\n\nStandardizing data\nA good way to handle this problem is to standardize the data so that all variables are given a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Then all variables will be on a comparable scale. The scale() function does just this. In standardizing the data, we exclude column 86, because that is the qualitative Purchase variable.\n\nstandardized.X <- scale(Caravan [,-86])\nvar(Caravan[,1])\n\n[1] 165.0378\n\nvar(Caravan[,2])\n\n[1] 0.1647078\n\nvar(standardized.X[,1])\n\n[1] 1\n\nvar(standardized.X[,2])\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nNow every column of standardized.X has a standard deviation of one and a mean of zero.\nWe now split the observations into a test set, containing the ﬁrst 1,000 observations, and a training set, containing the remaining observations. We ﬁt a KNN model on the training data using K = 1, and evaluate its performance on the test data.\n\ntest <- 1:1000\ntrain.X <- standardized.X[-test, ]\ntest.X <- standardized.X[test, ]\ntrain.Y <- Purchase[-test]\ntest.Y <- Purchase[test]\n\nset.seed(1)\nknn.pred <- knn(train.X, test.X, train.Y, k = 1)\nmean(test.Y != knn.pred )\n\n[1] 0.118\n\nmean(test.Y != \"No\")\n\n[1] 0.059\n\n\nThe vector test is numeric, with values from 1 through 1,000. Typing standardized.X[test, ] yields the submatrix of the data containing the observations whose indices range from 1 to 1,000, whereas typing standardized.X[-test, ] yields the submatrix containing the observations whose indices do not range from 1 to 1,000. The KNN error rate on the 1,000 test observations is just under 12%. At ﬁrst glance, this may appear to be fairly good. However, since only 6% of customers purchased insurance, we could get the error rate down to 6% by always predicting No regardless of the values of the predictors!\nSuppose that there is some non-trivial cost to trying to sell insurance to a given individual. For instance, perhaps a salesperson must visit each potential customer. If the company tries to sell insurance to a random selection of customers, then the success rate will be only 6%, which may be far too low given the costs involved. Instead, the company would like to try to sell insurance only to customers who are likely to buy it. So the overall error rate is not of interest. Instead, the fraction of individuals that are correctly predicted to buy insurance is of interest.\nIt turns out that KNN with K = 1 does far better than random guessing among the customers that are predicted to buy insurance. Among 77 such customers, 9, or 11.7%, actually do purchase insurance. This is double the rate that one would obtain from random guessing.\n\ntable(knn.pred, test.Y)\n\n        test.Y\nknn.pred  No Yes\n     No  873  50\n     Yes  68   9\n\n9/(68+9)\n\n[1] 0.1168831\n\n\n\n\nExploring KNN model tuning\nUsing K = 3 (implying there are 3 groupings of customers), the success rate increases to 19%, and with K = 5 (5 groups) the rate is 26.7%. This is over four times the rate that results from random guessing. It appears that KNN is ﬁnding some real patterns in a difficult data set!\n\nknn.pred <- knn(train.X, test.X, train.Y, k = 3)\ntable(knn.pred, test.Y)\n\n        test.Y\nknn.pred  No Yes\n     No  920  54\n     Yes  21   5\n\n5/26\n\n[1] 0.1923077\n\nknn.pred <- knn(train.X, test.X, train.Y, k = 5)\ntable(knn.pred, test.Y)\n\n        test.Y\nknn.pred  No Yes\n     No  930  55\n     Yes  11   4\n\n4/15\n\n[1] 0.2666667\n\n\n\n\nCompare to logistic regression\nAs a comparison, we can also ﬁt a logistic regression model to the data. If we use 0.5 as the predicted probability cut-off for the classifier, then we have a problem: only seven of the test observations are predicted to purchase insurance. Even worse, we are wrong about all of these! However, we are not required to use a cut-off of 0.5. If we instead predict a purchase any time the predicted probability of purchase exceeds 0.25, we get much better results: we predict that 33 people will purchase insurance, and we are correct for about 33% of these people. This is over ﬁve times better than random guessing!\n\nglm.fit <- glm(Purchase ~ ., data = Caravan, family = binomial,\n               subset = -test)\n\nWarning: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred\n\nglm.probs <- predict(glm.fit, Caravan[test, ], type = \"response\")\nglm.pred <- rep(\"No\" , 1000)\nglm.pred [glm.probs > .5]= \"Yes\"\ntable(glm.pred, test.Y)\n\n        test.Y\nglm.pred  No Yes\n     No  934  59\n     Yes   7   0\n\nglm.pred <- rep(\"No\", 1000)\nglm.pred[glm.probs > .25] <- \"Yes\"\ntable(glm.pred, test.Y)\n\n        test.Y\nglm.pred  No Yes\n     No  919  48\n     Yes  22  11\n\n11/(22+11 )\n\n[1] 0.3333333"

It is generally a good idea to set a random seed when performing an analysis such as cross-validation that contains an element of randomness, so that the results obtained can be reproduced precisely at a later time.\n\n\n\nWe begin by using the sample() function to split the set of observations into two halves, by selecting a random subset of 196 observations out of the original 392 observations.

We can use the glm() function to perform logistic regression by passing in the family=\"binomial\" argument. But if we use glm() to ﬁt a model without passing in the family argument, then it performs linear regression, just like the lm() function. So for instance,\n\n\ncv.glm()\n\n# glm() approach\nglm.fit <- glm(mpg ~ horsepower, data = Auto)\ncoef(glm.fit )\n\n(Intercept)  horsepower \n 39.9358610  -0.1578447 \n\n# lm() approach\nlm.fit <- lm(mpg ~ horsepower, data = Auto)\ncoef(lm.fit)\n\n(Intercept)  horsepower \n 39.9358610  -0.1578447 \n\n\nyield identical linear regression models. In this lab, we will perform linear regression using the glm() function rather than the lm() function because the latter can be used together with cv.glm(). The cv.glm() function is part of the {boot} library.\n\nlibrary(boot)\nglm.fit <- glm(mpg ~ horsepower, data = Auto )\ncv.err <- cv.glm(Auto, glm.fit)\ncv.err$delta\n\n[1] 24.23151 24.23114\n\n\nThe cv.glm() function produces a list with several components. The two numbers in the delta vector contain the cross-validation results. In this case the numbers are identical (up to two decimal places) and correspond to the LOOCV statistic (Ch 5 James et al. 2021). Below, we discuss a situation in which the two numbers differ. Our cross-validation estimate for the test error is approximately 24.23.\n\n\nfor()\nWe can repeat this procedure for increasingly complex polynomial fits. To automate the process, we use the for() function to initiate a for loop which iteratively ﬁts polynomial regressions for polynomials of order i = 1 to i = 5, computes the associated cross-validation error, and stores it in the ith element of the vector cv.error. We begin by initializing the vector. This command will likely take some time to run.\n\nlibrary(tictoc) # time your computer\ncv.error <- rep(0 ,5)\ntic()\nfor (i in 1:5){\n  glm.fit <- glm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, i), data = Auto)\n  cv.error[i] <- cv.glm(Auto, glm.fit)$delta[1]\n}\ntoc() # Ed's PC\n\n4.45 sec elapsed\n\ncv.error\n\n[1] 24.23151 19.24821 19.33498 19.42443 19.03321\n\nplot(cv.error, type='b')\n\n\n\n\nWe see a sharp drop in the estimated test MSE between the linear and quadratic ﬁts, but then no clear improvement from using higher-order polynomials.\n\n\nK-fold CV\nThe cv.glm() function can also be used to implement k-fold CV. Below we use k = 10, a common choice for k, on the Auto data set. We once again set a random seed and initialize a vector in which we will store the CV errors corresponding to the polynomial ﬁts of orders one to ten.\n\nset.seed(17)\ncv.error.10 <- rep (0 ,10)\nfor(i in  1:10) {\n  glm.fit <- glm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, i), data = Auto )\n  cv.error.10[i] = cv.glm(Auto, glm.fit, K = 10)$delta[1]\n}\ncv.error.10\n\n [1] 24.27207 19.26909 19.34805 19.29496 19.03198 18.89781 19.12061 19.14666\n [9] 18.87013 20.95520\n\nplot(cv.error.10, type='b')\n\n\n\n\nYou may notice that the computation time is much shorter than that of LOOCV. (In principle, the computation time for LOOCV for a least squares linear model should be faster than for k-fold CV, due to a mathematical shortcut for LOOCV (see Ch 5 James et al. 2021); however, unfortunately the cv.glm() function does not make use of this efficiency. We still see little evidence that using cubic or higher-order polynomial terms leads to lower test error than simply using a quadratic fit.\nThe two numbers associated with delta are essentially the same when LOOCV is performed. When we instead perform k-fold CV, then the two numbers associated with delta differ slightly. The first is the standard k-fold CV estimate and the second is a bias-corrected version. On this data set, we see the two estimates are very similar to each other."

    "section": "3 Bootstrap",
    "text": "3 Bootstrap\nWe will illustrate the use of the bootstrap in a simple example, as well as on an example involving estimating the accuracy of the linear regression model on the Auto data set.\n\nboot()\nOne of the great advantages of the bootstrap approach is that it can be applied in almost all situations. No complicated mathematical calculations are required. Performing a bootstrap analysis in R entails only two steps. First, we must create a function that computes the statistic of interest. Second, we use the boot() function, which is part of the {boot} library, to perform the bootstrap by repeatedly sampling observations from the data set with replacement.\nThe Portfolio data set in the {ISLR} package is described in Section 5.2. To illustrate the use of the bootstrap on this data, we must ﬁrst create a function, alpha.fn(), which takes as input the (X, Y) data as well as a vector indicating which observations should be used to estimate α. The function then outputs the estimate for α based on the selected observations.\n\n# make a fun function\nalpha.fn <- function(data, index){\n  X <- data$X[index]\n  Y <- data$Y[index]\n  return((var(Y) - cov (X, Y))/(var(X)+ var(Y)-2 * cov(X,Y)))\n}\n\nThis function returns, or outputs, an estimate for α based on the observations indexed by the argument index. For instance, the following command tells R to estimate α using all 100 observations.\n\nalpha.fn(Portfolio, 1:100)\n\n[1] 0.5758321\n\n\nThe next command uses the sample() function to randomly select 100 observations from the range 1 to 100, with replacement. This is equivalent to constructing a new bootstrap data set and recomputing \\(\\hat\\alpha\\) based on the new data set.\n\nset.seed(1)\nalpha.fn(Portfolio, sample(100, 100, replace = T))\n\n[1] 0.7368375\n\n\nWe can implement a bootstrap analysis by performing this command many times, recording all of the corresponding estimates for α, and computing the resulting standard deviation. However, the boot() function automates this approach. Below we produce R = 1,000 bootstrap estimates for α.\n\nset.seed(1)\nboot(Portfolio, alpha.fn, R = 1000)\n\n\nORDINARY NONPARAMETRIC BOOTSTRAP\n\n\nCall:\nboot(data = Portfolio, statistic = alpha.fn, R = 1000)\n\n\nBootstrap Statistics :\n     original       bias    std. error\nt1* 0.5758321 -0.001596422  0.09376093\n\n\nThe ﬁnal output shows that using the original data, \\(\\hat\\alpha= 0.58\\), and that the bootstrap estimate for \\(SE\\hat\\alpha = 0.09\\).\n\n\nRegression accuracy\nThe bootstrap approach can be used to assess the variability of the coef- ﬁcient estimates and predictions from a statistical learning method. Here we use the bootstrap approach in order to assess the variability of the estimates for \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\), the intercept and slope terms for the linear regression model that uses horsepower to predict mpg in the Auto data set. We will compare the estimates obtained using the bootstrap to those obtained using the formulas for \\(SE(\\hat\\beta_0)\\) and \\(SE(\\hat\\beta_1)\\).\nWe ﬁrst create a simple function, boot.fn(), which takes in the Auto data set as well as a set of indices for the observations, and returns the intercept and slope estimates for the linear regression model. We then apply this function to the full set of 392 observations in order to compute the estimates of \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) on the entire data set using the usual linear regression coefficient estimate formulas. Note that we do not need the { and } at the beginning and end of the function because it is only one line long.\n\nplot(mpg ~ horsepower, data = Auto)\nabline(lm(mpg ~ horsepower, data = Auto))\n\n\n\n# function!\nboot.fn <- function(data, index)\n  return(coef(lm(mpg ~ horsepower, data = data, subset = index)))\nboot.fn(Auto, 1:392)\n\n(Intercept)  horsepower \n 39.9358610  -0.1578447 \n\n\nThe boot.fn() function can also be used in order to create bootstrap estimates for the intercept and slope terms by randomly sampling from among the observations with replacement. Here are two examples:\n\n# first with a seed\nset.seed(1)\nboot.fn(Auto, sample(392, 392, replace = T)) \n\n(Intercept)  horsepower \n 40.3404517  -0.1634868 \n\n# no seed\nboot.fn(Auto, sample(392, 392, replace = T)) \n\n(Intercept)  horsepower \n 40.1186906  -0.1577063 \n\n\n\n\nBootstrap\n\nboot(Auto, boot.fn, 1000)\n\n\nORDINARY NONPARAMETRIC BOOTSTRAP\n\n\nCall:\nboot(data = Auto, statistic = boot.fn, R = 1000)\n\n\nBootstrap Statistics :\n      original        bias    std. error\nt1* 39.9358610  0.0544513229 0.841289790\nt2* -0.1578447 -0.0006170901 0.007343073\n\n\nand\nThis indicates that the bootstrap estimate for \\(SE(\\hat\\beta_0)\\) is 0.84, and that the bootstrap estimate for \\(SE(\\hat\\beta_1)\\) is 0.0074. Standard formulas can be used to compute the standard errors for the regression coefficients in a linear model. These can be obtained using the summary() function.\n\nsummary(lm(mpg ~ horsepower, data = Auto))$coef\n\n              Estimate  Std.

Does this indicate a problem with the bootstrap? In fact, it suggests the opposite. Consider that estimation of these parameters rely on certain assumptions. For example, they depend on the unknown parameter \\(\\sigma^2\\), the noise variance. We then estimate \\(\\sigma^2\\) using the RSS. Now although the formula for the standard errors do not rely on the linear model being correct, the estimate for \\(\\sigma^2\\) does. Also, there is a non-linear relationship in the data, and so the residuals from a linear ﬁt will be inflated, and so will \\(\\sigma^2\\). Secondly, standard linear regression assume (somewhat unrealistically) that the \\(x_i\\) values are ﬁxed, and all the variability comes from the variation in the errors \\(\\epsilon_i\\). The bootstrap approach does not rely on any of these assumptions, and so it is likely giving a more accurate estimate of the standard errors of \\(SE(\\hat\\beta_0)\\) and \\(SE(\\hat\\beta_1)\\) than is the summary() function.\nBelow we compute the bootstrap standard error estimates and the standard linear regression estimates that result from ﬁtting the quadratic model to the data. Since this model provides a good ﬁt to the data, there is now a better correspondence between the bootstrap estimates and the standard estimates of \\(SE(\\hat\\beta_0)\\), \\(SE(\\hat\\beta_1)\\) and \\(SE(\\hat\\beta_2)\\).\n\nboot.fn <- function(data, index){\n  coefficients(lm(mpg ~ horsepower + I(horsepower^2), \n                  data=data, \n                  subset = index))\n}\n\nset.seed(1)\nboot(Auto, boot.fn, 1000)\n\n\nORDINARY NONPARAMETRIC BOOTSTRAP\n\n\nCall:\nboot(data = Auto, statistic = boot.fn, R = 1000)\n\n\nBootstrap Statistics :\n        original        bias     std. error\nt1* 56.900099702  3.511640e-02 2.0300222526\nt2* -0.466189630 -7.080834e-04 0.0324241984\nt3*  0.001230536  2.840324e-06 0.0001172164\n\nsummary(lm(mpg ~ horsepower + I(horsepower^2), data = Auto))$coef\n\n                    Estimate   Std.

This can be done directly from within R. For example, on a Windows system, select the Install package option under the Packages tab. After you select any mirror site, a list of available packages will appear. Simply select the package you wish to install and R will automatically download the package. Alternatively, this can be done at the R command line via install.packages(\"ISLR\"). This installation only needs to be done the ﬁrst time you use a package.

We will seek to predict medv using 13 predictors such as rm (average number of rooms per house), age (average age of houses), and lstat (percent of households with low socioeconomic status).\n\nnames(Boston)\n\n [1] \"crim\"    \"zn\"      \"indus\"   \"chas\"    \"nox\"     \"rm\"      \"age\"    \n [8] \"dis\"     \"rad\"     \"tax\"     \"ptratio\" \"black\"   \"lstat\"   \"medv\"   \n\nhead(Boston)\n\n     crim zn indus chas   nox    rm  age    dis rad tax ptratio  black lstat\n1 0.00632 18  2.31    0 0.538 6.575 65.2 4.0900   1 296    15.3 396.90  4.98\n2 0.02731  0  7.07    0 0.469 6.421 78.9 4.9671   2 242    17.8 396.90  9.14\n3 0.02729  0  7.07    0 0.469 7.185 61.1 4.9671   2 242    17.8 392.83  4.03\n4 0.03237  0  2.18    0 0.458 6.998 45.8 6.0622   3 222    18.7 394.63  2.94\n5 0.06905  0  2.18    0 0.458 7.147 54.2 6.0622   3 222    18.7 396.90  5.33\n6 0.02985  0  2.18    0 0.458 6.430 58.7 6.0622   3 222    18.7 394.12  5.21\n  medv\n1 24.0\n2 21.6\n3 34.7\n4 33.4\n5 36.2\n6 28.7\n\n\n\n\n\nTo ﬁnd out more about the data set, we can type ?Boston. We will start by using the lm() function to ﬁt a simple linear regression model, with medv as the response and lstat as the predictor. The basic syntax is lm(y∼x,data), where y is the response, x is the predictor, and data is the data set in which these two variables are kept.\n\n# try this\n# lm.fit <- lm(medv~lstat)\n\nThe command causes an error because R does not know where to ﬁnd the variables medv and lstat. The next line tells R that the variables are in Boston. If we attach Boston, the ﬁrst line would work ﬁne because R now recognizes the variables. However, the data argument works here too.\n\nlm.fit <- lm(medv~lstat , data = Boston)\nattach(Boston)\nlm.fit <- lm(medv~lstat)\n\nIf we submit lm.fit, some basic information about the model is output. For more detailed information, we use summary(lm.fit). This gives us p-values and standard errors for the coeffcients, as well as the R2 statistic and F-statistic for the model.\n\nlm.fit\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = medv ~ lstat)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)        lstat  \n      34.55        -0.95  \n\nsummary(lm.fit)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = medv ~ lstat)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-15.168  -3.990  -1.318   2.034  24.500 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

As expected, the conﬁdence and prediction intervals are centered around the same point (a predicted value of 25.05 for medv when lstat equals 10), but the latter are substantially wider.\nWe will now plot medv and lstat along with the least squares regression line using the plot() and abline() functions.\n\nplot(lstat , medv)\nabline(lm.fit)\n\n\n\n\nThere is some visual evidence for non-linearity in the relationship between lstat and medv. We will explore this issue later in this lab.\nThe abline() function can be used to draw any line, not just the least squares regression line. To draw a line with intercept a and slope b, we type abline(a,b). Below we experiment with some additional settings for plotting lines and points. The lwd=3 command causes the width of the regression line to be increased by a factor of 3; this works for the plot() and lines() functions also. We can also use the pch option to create different plotting symbols.\n\nplot(lstat , medv)\nabline(lm.fit, lwd = 3)\n\n\n\nplot(lstat , medv)\nabline(lm.fit, lwd = 3, col = \"red\")\n\n\n\nplot(lstat, medv, col = \"red\")\n\n\n\nplot(lstat, medv, pch = 20)\n\n\n\nplot(lstat, medv, pch =\"+\")\n\n\n\nplot(1:20, 1:20, pch = 1:20)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext we examine some diagnostic plots (discussed in Section 3.3.3 of James et al. 2021). Four diagnostic plots are automatically produced by applying the plot() function directly to the output from lm(). In general, this command will produce one plot at a time, and hitting Enter will generate the next plot. However, it is often convenient to view all four plots together. We can achieve this by using the par() function, which tells R to split the display screen into separate panels so that multiple plots can be viewed simultaneously. For example, par(mfrow=c(2,2)) divides the plotting region into a 2 × 2 grid of panels.\n\npar(mfrow = c(2, 2))\nplot(lm.fit)\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the residuals from a linear regression ﬁt using the residuals() function. The function rstudent() will return the studentized residuals, and we can use this function to plot the residuals against the ﬁtted values.\n\npar(mfrow = c(1, 3))\nplot(predict(lm.fit), residuals(lm.fit))\nplot(predict(lm.fit), rstudent(lm.fit))\nplot(residuals(lm.fit), rstudent(lm.fit)) # hmm actually these are the same\n\n\n\n\nOn the basis of the residual plots, there is some evidence of non-linearity. Leverage statistics can be computed for any number of predictors using the hatvalues() function.\n\npar(mfrow = c(1, 1))\nplot(hatvalues(lm.fit))\n\n\n\nwhich.max(hatvalues(lm.fit)) \n\n375 \n375 \n\n\nThe which.max() function identiﬁes the index of the largest element of a vector. In this case, it tells us which observation has the largest leverage statistic."

For instance, given a predictor \\(X\\), we can create a predictor \\(X^2\\) using I(X^2). The function I() is needed since the ^ has a special meaning in a formula; wrapping as we do allows the standard usage in R, which is to raise X to the power 2.

The anova() function performs a hypothesis test comparing the two models. The null hypothesis is that the two models ﬁt the data equally well, and the alternative hypothesis is that the full model is superior. Here the F-statistic is 135 and the associated p-value is virtually zero. This provides very clear evidence that the model containing the predictors lstat and lstat\\(^2\\) is far superior to the model that only contains the predictor lstat (based on the results that the RSS, the unexplained error, is higher in Model 1). This is not surprising, since earlier we saw evidence for non-linearity in the relationship between medv and lstat. If we type\n\npar(mfrow = c(2, 2))\nplot(lm.fit2)\n\n\n\npar(mfrow = c(1, 1))\n\nthen we see that when the lstat\\(^2\\) term is included in the model, there is little discernible pattern in the residuals.\n\n\npoly()\nIn order to create a cubic ﬁt, we can include a predictor of the form I(X^3). However, this approach can start to get cumbersome for higher-order polynomials. A better approach involves using the poly() function to create the polynomial within lm().

However, further investigation of the data reveals that no polynomial terms beyond ﬁfth order have signiﬁ- cant p-values in a regression ﬁt.\n\n\nlog() transformation\nOf course, we are in no way restricted to using polynomial transformations of the predictors. Here we try a log() transformation.\n\nsummary(lm(medv~log(rm), data = Boston))\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = medv ~ log(rm), data = Boston)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-19.487  -2.875  -0.104   2.837  39.816 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

R has created a ShelveLocGood dummy variable that takes on a value of 1 if the shelving location is good, and 0 otherwise. It has also created a ShelveLocMedium dummy variable that equals 1 if the shelving location is medium, and 0 otherwise. A bad shelving location corresponds to a zero for each of the two dummy variables. The fact that the coeﬃcient for\nShelveLocGood in the regression output is positive indicates that a good shelving location is associated with high sales (relative to a bad location). And ShelveLocMedium has a smaller positive coeffcient, indicating that a medium shelving location leads to higher sales than a bad shelving location but lower sales than a good shelving location.\n\n\nWriting functions\nAs we have seen, R comes with many useful functions, and still more functions are available by way of R libraries. However, we will often be interested in performing an operation for which no function is available. In this setting, we may want to write our own function. For instance, below we provide a simple function that reads in the {ISLR} and {MASS} libraries, called LoadLibraries(). Before we have created the function, R returns an error if we try to call it.\n\n# try this\n# LoadLibraries()\n\nWe now create the function. The { symbol informs R that multiple commands are about to be input. Hitting Enter after typing { will cause R to print the + symbol. We can then input as many commands as we wish, hitting Enter after each one. Finally the } symbol informs R that no further commands will be entered.\n\nLoadLibraries <- function(){\n  library(ISLR)\n  library(MASS)\n  print (\"The libraries have been loaded.\")\n  }\n\nNow if we type in LoadLibraries,R will tell us what is in the function.\n\nLoadLibraries()\n\n[1] \"The libraries have been loaded.\""

    "text": "1 Basic commands\n\nc()\nR uses functions to perform operations. To run a function called funcname, we type funcname(input1, input2), where the inputs (or arguments) input1 and input2 tell R how to run the function. A function can have any number of inputs. For example, to create a vector of numbers, we use the function c() (for concatenate). Any numbers inside the parentheses are joined together. The following command instructs R to join together the numbers 1, 3, 2, and 5, and to save them as a vector named x. When we type x, it gives us back the vector.\n\nx <- c(1,3,2,5)\nx\n\n[1] 1 3 2 5\n\n\n\n\n<- value assignment\nWe can also “save things” (i.e. assign values) using = rather than <-, though the “arrow” syntax is the standard style in R:\n\nx = c(1,6,2)\nx\n\n[1] 1 6 2\n\ny = c(1,4,3) # why doesn't this \"print out\"?\n\n\n\nlength()\nHitting the up arrow multiple times will display the previous commands, which can then be edited. This is useful since one often wishes to repeat a similar command. In addition, typing ?funcname will always cause R to open a new help file window with additional information about the function funcname. We can tell R to add two sets of numbers together. It will then add the first number from x to the first number from y, and so on. However, x and y should be the same length. We can check their length using the length() function.\n\n\nls() , rm()\nThe ls() function allows us to look at a list of all of the objects, such as data and functions, that we have saved so far. The rm() function can be used to delete any that we don’t want.\n\nls()\n\n[1] \"x\" \"y\"\n\nrm(x,y)\nls()\n\ncharacter(0)\n\n\nIt’s also possible to remove all objects at once without explicitly naming them (handy of you have more than few data objects in you Global Environment):\n\nx = c(1,6,2)\ny = c(1,4,3)\nls()\n\n[1] \"x\" \"y\"\n\nrm(list=ls()) # do you see what the 'list' argument does here?\nls()\n\ncharacter(0)\n\n\n\n\nmatrix()\nThe matrix() function is used to create a matrix of numbers. Before we use the matrix() function, we can learn more about it to examine the arguments:\n\n# ?matrix\n\nThe help ﬁle reveals that the matrix() function takes a number of inputs, but for now we focus on the ﬁrst three: the data (the entries in the matrix), the number of rows, and the number of columns. First, we create a simple matrix.\n\nx <-  matrix( data=c(1 ,2 ,3 ,4) , nrow =2 , ncol =2)\nx\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    3\n[2,]    2    4\n\n\nNote that we could just as well omit explicitly typing data=, nrow=, and ncol= in the matrix() command above: that is, we could just type:\n\nx <- matrix ( c(1 ,2 ,3 ,4) ,2 ,2)\n\nand this would have the same effect. However, it can sometimes be useful to specify the names of the arguments passed in, since otherwise R will assume that the function arguments are passed into the function in the same order that is given in the function’s help ﬁle. As this example illustrates, by default R creates matrices by successively ﬁlling in columns. Alternatively, the byrow=TRUE option can be used to populate the matrix in order of the rows.\n\nx <- matrix ( c(1 ,2 ,3 ,4) ,2 ,2, byrow=TRUE)\n\n\n\nsqrt() sqare root\nNotice that in the above command we did not assign the matrix to a value such as x. In this case the matrix is printed to the screen but is not saved for future calculations. The sqrt() function returns the square root of each element of a vector or matrix. The command x^2 raises each element of x to the power 2; any powers are possible, including fractional or negative powers.\n\nsqrt(x)\n\n         [,1]     [,2]\n[1,] 1.000000 1.414214\n[2,] 1.732051 2.000000\n\nx^2\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    4\n[2,]    9   16\n\n\n\n\nrnorm(), cor() random Gaussian numbers, correlation\nThe rnorm() function generates a vector of random normal variables, with ﬁrst argument n the sample size. Each time we call this function, we will get a diﬀerent answer. Here we create two correlated sets of numbers, x and y, and use the cor() function to compute the correlation between them.\n\nx <- rnorm(50)\ny <- x+ rnorm(50 , mean =50 , sd =.1)\ncor(x, y)\n\n[1] 0.995032\n\n\n\n\nset.seed makes ‘pseudo-random’ events repeatable\nBy default, rnorm() creates standard normal random variables with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. However, the mean and standard devi- ation can be altered using the mean and sd arguments, as illustrated above. Sometimes we want our code to reproduce the exact same set of random numbers; we can use the set.seed() function to do this. The set.seed() function takes an (arbitrary) integer argument.\n\nrnorm(5); rnorm(5)\n\n[1]  0.2689178  0.1237465 -2.0645587  0.5066851  0.2826564\n\n\n[1]  0.8787616  0.9442790 -1.2917376  0.4827161  0.3612890\n\nset.seed(42); rnorm(5); set.seed(42); rnorm(5)\n\n[1]  1.3709584 -0.5646982  0.3631284  0.6328626  0.4042683\n\n\n[1]  1.3709584 -0.5646982  0.3631284  0.6328626  0.4042683\n\n\nWe will endeavor to use set.seed() throughout the labs whenever we perform calculations involving random quantities. In general this should allow the user to reproduce the results. However, it should be noted that as new versions of R become available discrepancies may form between the labs and the output from R.\n\n\nmean(), sd(), and var()\nThe mean() and var() functions can be used to compute the mean and variance of a vector of numbers. Applying sqrt() to the output of var() will give the standard deviation. Or we can simply use the sd() function.\n\nset.seed(3)\ny <- rnorm(100, 10, 1)\nmean(y)\n\n[1] 10.01104\n\nvar(y)\n\n[1] 0.7328675\n\nsqrt(y)\n\n  [1] 3.006338 3.115682 3.202934 2.974537 3.193084 3.167037 3.175755 3.334158\n  [9] 2.963299 3.356690 3.042239 2.978050 3.046907 3.201976 3.186228 3.113253\n [17] 3.007820 3.058064 3.350271 3.193714 3.069449 3.009601 3.129900 2.886785\n [25] 3.084728 3.042849 3.340751 3.318443 3.150860 2.977116 3.301609 3.294203\n [33] 3.275319 3.276660 3.106102 3.271928 3.361601 3.168320 3.003451 3.285386\n [41] 3.284282 3.112802 3.420363 3.034041 3.216899 2.781115 3.136526 3.336295\n [49] 3.089410 3.016759 3.275185 3.031593 3.204229 2.874498 2.930627 3.089733\n [57] 2.994079 3.370778 3.304157 3.035598 3.251695 3.304269 3.202544 3.217447\n [65] 3.342804 3.085313 3.095347 3.309851 2.951439 3.191582 3.157321 3.235289\n [73] 3.320271 3.204272 3.198723 3.278352 3.349189 3.222322 3.001991 3.137379\n [81] 3.425717 3.106075 3.269349 3.350284 3.285467 3.161265 3.196741 3.018863\n [89] 3.231062 3.018876 3.024265 3.001667 3.057633 3.324748 3.099858 3.151097\n [97] 3.088357 3.246676 3.306302 3.129014\n\nsd(y)\n\n[1] 0.8560768"

There are many additional options that can be passed in to the plot() function. For example, passing in the argument xlab will result in a label on the x-axis. To ﬁnd out more information about the plot() function, don’t forget to use ?plot.\n\nx <- rnorm(100)\ny <- rnorm(100)\nplot(x,y) # yuck\n\n\n\nplot(x,y, xlab=\" this is the x- axis\", \n     ylab =\" this is the y - axis\", \n     main =\" Plot of X vs Y \") # better\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput functions pdf(), png(), jpg()\nWe will often want to save the output of an R plot. The command that we use to do this will depend on the ﬁle type that we would like to create. For instance, to create a pdf, we use the pdf() function, and to create a jpeg, we use the jpeg() function, png(), etc.\n\n# This code will output a graph file to your working directory\npng(\"MyFigure.png\") # think of this as opening the file\nplot(x, y, pch=16, col =\"green\") # writing something for that file\ndev.off() # turning off the output to file\n\npng \n  2 \n\n\nThe function dev.off() indicates to R that we are done creating the plot. Alternatively, we can simply copy the plot window and paste it into an appropriate ﬁle type, such as a Word document.\n\n\nseq()\nThe function seq() can be used to create a sequence of numbers. For instance, seq(a,b) makes a vector of integers between a and b. There are many other options: for instance, seq(0,1,length=10) makes a sequence of 10 numbers that are equally spaced between 0 and 1. Typing 3:11 is a shorthand for seq(3,11) for integer arguments.\n\nx <- seq(1,10)\nx\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\nx <- 1:10\nx\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\nx <- seq(-pi, pi, length = 50)\nx\n\n [1] -3.14159265 -3.01336438 -2.88513611 -2.75690784 -2.62867957 -2.50045130\n [7] -2.37222302 -2.24399475 -2.11576648 -1.98753821 -1.85930994 -1.73108167\n[13] -1.60285339 -1.47462512 -1.34639685 -1.21816858 -1.08994031 -0.96171204\n[19] -0.83348377 -0.70525549 -0.57702722 -0.44879895 -0.32057068 -0.19234241\n[25] -0.06411414  0.06411414  0.19234241  0.32057068  0.44879895  0.57702722\n[31]  0.70525549  0.83348377  0.96171204  1.08994031  1.21816858  1.34639685\n[37]  1.47462512  1.60285339  1.73108167  1.85930994  1.98753821  2.11576648\n[43]  2.24399475  2.37222302  2.50045130  2.62867957  2.75690784  2.88513611\n[49]  3.01336438  3.14159265"

    "text": "3 Special plots\n\ncontour() plot\nWe will now create some more sophisticated plots. The contour() function produces a contour plot in order to represent three-dimensional data; it is like a topographical map. It takes three arguments:\n\nA vector of the x values (the ﬁrst dimension),\nA vector of the y values (the second dimension), and\nA matrix whose elements correspond to the z value (the third dimension) for each pair of (x,y) coordinates.\n\nAs with the plot() function, there are many other inputs that can be used to ﬁne tune the output of the contour() function. To learn more about these, take a look at the help ﬁle by typing ?contour.\n\n# don't worry too much about this code, but can you figure out what it does?\n\nx <- y <- 1:10\nf <- outer(x,y, function(x,y) cos(y)/(1+x^2))\ncontour(x,y,f)\n\n\n\nfa <- ( f- t(f))/2\ncontour (x,y, fa , nlevels = 15)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage() and persp()\nThe image() function works the same way as contour(), except that it produces a color-coded plot whose colors depend on the z value. This is known as a heatmap, and is sometimes used to plot temperature in weather forecasts. Alternatively, persp() can be used to produce a three-dimensional plot. The arguments theta and phi control the angles at which the plot is viewed.\n\nimage(x, y, fa)\n\n\n\npersp(x, y, fa)\n\n\n\npersp(x, y, fa, theta =30)\n\n\n\npersp(x, y, fa, theta =30, phi = 20) # not enough\n\n\n\npersp(x, y, fa, theta =30, phi = 70) # too much\n\n\n\npersp(x, y, fa, theta =30, phi = 40) # juust right"

Suppose that our data is stored in the matrix A.\n\nA <- matrix(1:16, 4, 4)\nA\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]\n[1,]    1    5    9   13\n[2,]    2    6   10   14\n[3,]    3    7   11   15\n[4,]    4    8   12   16\n\n\nThen submitting:\n\nA[2,3]\n\n[1] 10\n\n\nwill select the element corresponding to the second row and the third co umn. The ﬁrst number after the open-bracket symbol [ always refers to the row, and the second number always refers to the column. We can also select multiple rows and columns at a time, by providing vectors as the indices.\n\nA[c(1,3), c(2,4)]\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    5   13\n[2,]    7   15\n\nA[1:3, 2:4]\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    5    9   13\n[2,]    6   10   14\n[3,]    7   11   15\n\nA[1:2,]\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]\n[1,]    1    5    9   13\n[2,]    2    6   10   14\n\nA[,1:2]\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    5\n[2,]    2    6\n[3,]    3    7\n[4,]    4    8\n\n\nThe last two examples include either no index for the columns or no index for the rows.

The read.table() function is one of the primary ways to do this. The help ﬁle contains details about how to use this function. We can use the function write.table() to export data.\nBefore attempting to load a data set, we must make sure that R knows to search for the data in the proper directory. For example on a Windows system one could select the directory using the Change dir... option under the File menu. However, the details of how to do this depend on the operating system (e.g. Windows, Mac, Unix) that is being used.\nHere you will begin by loading in the Auto data set, which is part of the R library {ISLR2}, but to illustrate the read.table() function we load it now from a text ﬁle. The following command will load the Auto.data ﬁle into R and store it as an object called Auto, in a format referred to as a data frame.\n\n\nAuto data\nDownload the Auto.csv data file\nOnce the data has been loaded, the fix() function can be used to view it in a spreadsheet like window. However, the window must be closed before further R commands can be entered.\n\n# Your code may look similar\n# Auto <- read.csv(\"Auto.csv\")\n# fix(Auto)\n\nPeek at the data (note the view may wrap around the lines)\n\n\n  mpg cylinders displacement horsepower weight acceleration year origin\n1  18         8          307        130   3504         12.0   70      1\n2  15         8          350        165   3693         11.5   70      1\n3  18         8          318        150   3436         11.0   70      1\n4  16         8          304        150   3433         12.0   70      1\n5  17         8          302        140   3449         10.5   70      1\n6  15         8          429        198   4341         10.0   70      1\n                       name\n1 chevrolet chevelle malibu\n2         buick skylark 320\n3        plymouth satellite\n4             amc rebel sst\n5               ford torino\n6          ford galaxie 500\n\n\nNote that data like these are usually simply a text ﬁle, which you could alternatively open on your computer using a standard text editor. It is often a good idea to view a data set using a text editor or other software such as Excel before loading it into R…\nThis particular data set has probably not loaded correctly for you on the first try, because\n\nR has assumed that the variable names are part of the data and so has included them in the ﬁrst row.\nThe data set also includes a number of missing observations, indicated by a question mark ?.\nThere is a problematic character (at least one…) in the name variable on row 12.\n\nMissing values are a common occurrence in real data sets. Using the argument header=T (or header=TRUE) in the read.table() function tells R that the ﬁrst line of the ﬁle contains the variable names, and using the option na.strings tells R that any time it sees a particular character or set of characters (such as a question mark), it should be treated as a missing element of the data matrix.\n\n# try this\n# Auto <- read.csv(\"data/Auto.csv\", sep = ',', header = T , na.strings = \"?\")\n# fix(Auto)\n\nOnce the data are loaded correctly\n\n# try this\n\n# dim(Auto)\n# Auto[1:4, ]\n# names(Auto)\n\n\n\nGraphical and numerical summary\nWe can use the plot() function to produce scatterplots of the quantitative variables. However, simply typing the variable names will produce an error message, because R does not know to look inside the Auto data object for those variables.\n\n\n\n\n# try this\n# plot(cylinders, mpg) #error\n# Error in plot(cylinders, mpg) : object 'cylinders' not found\n\n\nplot( Auto$cylinders,  Auto$mpg )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nattach()\nTo refer to a variable explicitly, we can type the data set and the variable name joined with a $ (cash) symbol. Alternatively, we can use the attach() function in order to tell R to make the variables in this data frame available by name.\n\nattach(Auto)\nplot(cylinders, mpg)\n\n\n\n\nThe cylinders variable is stored as a numeric vector, so R has treated it as quantitative. However, since there are only a small number of possible values for cylinders, one may prefer to treat it as a qualitative variable. The as.factor() function converts quantitative variables into qualitative variables.\n\ncylinders <- as.factor(cylinders)\n\nIf a variable plotted on the x-axis is categorial, then boxplots will automatically be produced by the plot() function. As usual, a number of options can be speciﬁed in order to customize the plots.\n\nplot(cylinders, mpg)\n\n\n\nplot(cylinders, mpg, col =\"goldenrod\") # Ed's favourite R colour\n\n\n\nplot(cylinders, mpg, col =\"goldenrod\", varwidth = T)\n\n\n\nplot(cylinders, mpg, col =\"goldenrod\", varwidth = T , horizontal = T)\n\n\n\nplot(cylinders, mpg, col =\"goldenrod\", varwidth = T , \n     xlab=\"cylinders\", ylab =\"MPG\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhist()\nThe hist() function can be used to plot a histogram. Note that indexing the base color pallette numerically is possible, such that col=2 has the same effect as col=\"red\".\n\nhist(mpg)\n\n\n\nhist(mpg, col = 2)\n\n\n\nhist(mpg, col = 2, breaks = 15)\n\n\n\n\n\n\npairs()\nThe pairs() function creates a scatterplot matrix i.e. a scatterplot for every pair of variables for any given data set. We can also produce scatterplots for just a subset of the variables.\n\npairs(~ mpg + displacement + horsepower + weight + acceleration, Auto )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nidentify()\nIn conjunction with the plot() function, identify() provides a useful interactive method for identifying the value for a particular variable for points on a plot. We pass in three arguments to identify(): the x-axis variable, the y-axis variable, and the variable whose values we would like to see printed for each point. Then clicking on a given point in the plot will cause R to print the value of the variable of interest. Right-clicking on the plot will exit the identify() function (control-click on a Mac). The numbers printed under the identify() function correspond to the rows for the selected points.\n\nplot(horsepower, mpg)\n\n\n\n# this only works on your local machine - try it\n# identify(horsepower, mpg, name)\n\n\n\nsummary()\nThe summary() function produces a numerical summary of each variable in a particular data set.\n\nsummary(Auto)\n\n      mpg          cylinders      displacement     horsepower        weight    \n Min.   : 9.00   Min.   :3.000   Min.   : 68.0   Min.   : 46.0   Min.   :1613  \n 1st Qu.:17.00   1st Qu.:4.000   1st Qu.:105.0   1st Qu.: 75.0   1st Qu.:2225  \n Median :22.75   Median :4.000   Median :151.0   Median : 93.5   Median :2804  \n Mean   :23.45   Mean   :5.472   Mean   :194.4   Mean   :104.5   Mean   :2978  \n 3rd Qu.:29.00   3rd Qu.:8.000   3rd Qu.:275.8   3rd Qu.:126.0   3rd Qu.:3615  \n Max.   :46.60   Max.   :8.000   Max.   :455.0   Max.   :230.0   Max.   :5140  \n                                                                               \n  acceleration        year           origin                      name    \n Min.   : 8.00   Min.   :70.00   Min.   :1.000   amc matador       :  5  \n 1st Qu.:13.78   1st Qu.:73.00   1st Qu.:1.000   ford pinto        :  5  \n Median :15.50   Median :76.00   Median :1.000   toyota corolla    :  5  \n Mean   :15.54   Mean   :75.98   Mean   :1.577   amc gremlin       :  4  \n 3rd Qu.:17.02   3rd Qu.:79.00   3rd Qu.:2.000   amc hornet        :  4  \n Max.   :24.80   Max.   :82.00   Max.   :3.000   chevrolet chevette:  4  \n                                                 (Other)           :365  \n\n\nFor qualitative variables such as name, R will list the number of observations that fall in each category.

When exiting R, we have the option to save the current workspace so that all objects (such as data sets) that we have created in this R session will be available next time. Before exiting R, we may want to save a record of all of the commands that we typed in the most recent session; this can be accomplished using the savehistory() function. Next time we enter R, we can load that history using the loadhistory() function (useful in some circumstances)."

    "text": "5 Exercises\n\nExercise 1\nThis exercise relates to the College data set csv file. It contains a number of variables for 777 different universities in the US. The variables are\n\nPrivate : Public/private indicator\nApps : Number of applications received\nAccept : Number of applicants accepted\nEnroll : Number of new students enrolled\nTop10perc : New students from top 10% of high school class\nTop25perc : New students from top 25% of high school class\nF.Undergrad : Number of full-time undergraduates\nP.Undergrad : Number of part-time undergraduates\nOutstate : Out-of-state tuition\nRoom.Board : Room and board costs\nBooks : Estimated book costs\nPersonal : Estimated personal spending\nPhD : Percent of faculty with Ph.D.’s\nTerminal : Percent of faculty with terminal degree\nS.F.Ratio : Student/faculty ratio\nperc.alumni : Percent of alumni who donate\nExpend : Instructional expenditure per student\nGrad.Rate : Graduation rate\n\nBefore reading the data into R, it can be viewed in Excel or a text editor.\n\n1.1\nUse the read.csv() function to read the data into R. Call the loaded data college. Make sure that you have the directory set to the correct location for the data.\n\n\n1.2\nLook at the data using the View() function. You should notice that the first column is just the name of each university. We don’t really want R to treat this as data. However, it may be handy to have these names for later. Try the following commands:\n\n# try this\n# rownames(college) <- college[, 1]\n# View(college) \n\nYou should see that there is now a row.names column with the name of each university recorded. This means that R has given each row a name corresponding to the appropriate university. R will not try to perform calculations on the row names. However, we still need to eliminate the first column in the data where the names are stored. Try\n\n# try this\n# college <- college[, 1]\n# View(college) \n\nNow you should see that the first data column is Private. Note that another column labeled row.names now appears before the Private column. However, this is not a data column but rather the name that R is giving to each row.\n\n\n1.3\nUse the summary() function to produce a numerical summary of the variables in the data set.\n\n\n1.4\nUse the pairs() function to produce a scatterplot matrix of the first ten columns or variables of the data. Recall that you can reference the first ten columns of a matrix A using A[,1:10].\n\n\n1.5\nUse the plot() function to produce side-by-side boxplots of Outstate versus Private. Briefly interpret the information the graph conveys.\n\n\n1.6\nCreate a new qualitative variable, called Elite, by binning the Top10perc variable. We are going to divide universities into two groups based on whether or not the proportion of students coming from the top 10% of their high school classes exceeds 50%.\n\n\n1.7\nUse the summary() function to see how many elite universities there are. Now use the plot() function to produce side-by-side boxplots of Outstate versus Elite. Briefly interpret the information the graph conveys.\n\n\n1.8\nUse the hist() function to produce some histograms with differing numbers of bins for a few of the quantitative variables. You may find the command par(mfrow = c(2, 2)) useful: it will divide the print window into four regions so that four plots can be made simultaneously. Modifying the arguments to this function will divide the screen in other ways."

    "text": "I just watched an old film called The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance that tells the story of a shockingly lawless time in the American West at some time in the 1800s, which is so long ago that it somehow makes the violence easier to accept. However, the USArrests data are from 1973…\n\nIn this lab, we perform PCA on the USArrests data set, which is part of the base R package. The rows of the data set contain the 50 US states, in alphabetical order.\n\nstates <- row.names(USArrests)\nstates\n\n [1] \"Alabama\"        \"Alaska\"         \"Arizona\"        \"Arkansas\"      \n [5] \"California\"     \"Colorado\"       \"Connecticut\"    \"Delaware\"      \n [9] \"Florida\"        \"Georgia\"        \"Hawaii\"         \"Idaho\"         \n[13] \"Illinois\"       \"Indiana\"        \"Iowa\"           \"Kansas\"        \n[17] \"Kentucky\"       \"Louisiana\"      \"Maine\"          \"Maryland\"      \n[21] \"Massachusetts\"  \"Michigan\"       \"Minnesota\"      \"Mississippi\"   \n[25] \"Missouri\"       \"Montana\"        \"Nebraska\"       \"Nevada\"        \n[29] \"New Hampshire\"  \"New Jersey\"     \"New Mexico\"     \"New York\"      \n[33] \"North Carolina\" \"North Dakota\"   \"Ohio\"           \"Oklahoma\"      \n[37] \"Oregon\"         \"Pennsylvania\"   \"Rhode Island\"   \"South Carolina\"\n[41] \"South Dakota\"   \"Tennessee\"      \"Texas\"          \"Utah\"          \n[45] \"Vermont\"        \"Virginia\"       \"Washington\"     \"West Virginia\" \n[49] \"Wisconsin\"      \"Wyoming\"       \n\n\nThe columns of the data set contain the four variables.\n\nnames(USArrests)\n\n[1] \"Murder\"   \"Assault\"  \"UrbanPop\" \"Rape\"    \n\n\nWe first briefly examine the data. We notice that the variables have vastly different means.\n\napply(USArrests, 2, mean)\n\n  Murder  Assault UrbanPop     Rape \n   7.788  170.760   65.540   21.232 \n\n\nNote that the apply() function allows us use a function, in this case the mean() function, on each row or column of a data set. The second input here denotes whether we wish to compute the mean of the rows, 1, or the columns, 2. We see that there are on average three times as many rapes as murders, and more than eight times as many assaults as rapes.\nWe can also examine the standard deviation of each variable using the apply() function.\n\napply(USArrests, 2, sd)\n\n   Murder   Assault  UrbanPop      Rape \n 4.355510 83.337661 14.474763  9.366385 \n\n\nNot surprisingly, the variables also have vastly different variances: the UrbanPop variable measures the percentage of the population in each state living in an urban area, which is not a comparable number to the number of rapes in each state per 100,000 individuals. If we failed to scale the variables before performing PCA, then most of the principal components that we observed would be driven by the Assault variable, since it has by far the largest mean and variance. Thus, it is important to standardize the variables to have mean zero and standard deviation one before performing PCA.\n\n\nWe now perform principal components analysis using the prcomp() function, which is one of several functions in R that perform PCA.\n\npr.out <- prcomp(USArrests, scale = TRUE)\n\nBy default, the prcomp() function centers the variables to have mean zero. By using the option scale = TRUE, we scale the variables to have standard deviation one. The output from prcomp() contains a number of useful quantities.\n\nnames(pr.out)\n\n[1] \"sdev\"     \"rotation\" \"center\"   \"scale\"    \"x\"       \n\n\nThe center and scale components correspond to the means and standard deviations of the variables that were used for scaling prior to implementing PCA.\n\npr.out$center\n\n  Murder  Assault UrbanPop     Rape \n   7.788  170.760   65.540   21.232 \n\npr.out$scale\n\n   Murder   Assault  UrbanPop      Rape \n 4.355510 83.337661 14.474763  9.366385 \n\n\nThe rotation matrix provides the principal component loadings; each column of pr.out$rotation contains the corresponding principal component loading vector. This function names it the rotation matrix, because when we matrix-multiply the \\(X\\) matrix by pr.out$rotation, it gives us the coordinates of the data in the rotated coordinate system. These coordinates are the principal component scores.\n\npr.out$rotation\n\n                PC1        PC2        PC3         PC4\nMurder   -0.5358995  0.4181809 -0.3412327  0.64922780\nAssault  -0.5831836  0.1879856 -0.2681484 -0.74340748\nUrbanPop -0.2781909 -0.8728062 -0.3780158  0.13387773\nRape     -0.5434321 -0.1673186  0.8177779  0.08902432\n\n\nWe see that there are four distinct principal components. This is to be expected because there are in general min(n 1, p) informative principal components in a data set with n observations and p variables.\nUsing the prcomp() function, we do not need to explicitly multiply the data by the principal component loading vectors in order to obtain the principal component score vectors. Rather the \\(50 \\times 4\\) matrix x has as its columns the principal component score vectors. That is, the kth column is the kth principal component score vector.\n\ndim(pr.out$x)\n\n[1] 50  4\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can plot the first two principal components as follows:\n\n# State name labels:\n# the coordinates of the pc1 and pc2 scores\n\n# The vectors:\n# the coordinates of the pc1 and pc2 rotation\n\nbiplot(pr.out, scale = 0)\n\n\n\n\nThe scale = 0 argument to biplot() ensures that the arrows are scaled to represent the loadings; other values for scale give slightly diﬀerent biplots with different interpretations.\n\n\n\nThe variance explained by each principal component is obtained by squaring the standard deviations:\n\npr.var <- pr.out$sdev^2\npr.var\n\n[1] 2.4802416 0.9897652 0.3565632 0.1734301\n\n\nIt is often useful to understand the proportion of variance explained by each principal component, we simply divide the variance explained by each principal component by the total variance explained by all four principal components:\n\npve <- pr.var / sum(pr.var)\npve\n\n[1] 0.62006039 0.24744129 0.08914080 0.04335752\n\n\nWe see that the first principal component explains 62.0% of the variance in the data, the next principal component explains 24.7% of the variance, and so forth. We can plot the PVE explained by each component, as well as the cumulative PVE, as follows:\n\npar(mfrow = c(1, 2))\n\nplot (pve, xlab = \"Principal Component\",\n      ylab = \"Proportion of Variance Explained\", \n      ylim = c(0, 1) , type = \"b\",\n      pch = 16, col = 'red')\n\nplot(cumsum(pve), xlab = \"Principal Component\",\n     ylab = \"Cumulative Proportion of Variance Explained\", \n     ylim = c(0, 1) , type = \"b\",\n     pch = 16, col = 'blue')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na <- c(1, 2, 8, -3)\ncumsum(a)\n\n[1]  1  3 11  8"

If there were more than two variables then we could instead perform PCA and plot the first two principal components score vectors.\nIn this example, we knew that there really were two clusters because we generated the data. However, for real data, in general we do not know the true number of clusters.

If a value of nstart greater than one is used, then K-means clustering will be performed using multiple random assignments, and the kmeans() function will report only the best results. Here we compare using nstart = 1 to nstart = 20.\n\nset.seed(4)\nkm.out <- kmeans (x, 3, nstart = 1)\nkm.out$tot.withinss\n\n[1] 104.3319\n\nset.seed(4)\nkm.out <- kmeans(x, 3, nstart = 20)\nkm.out$tot.withinss\n\n[1] 97.97927\n\n\nNote that km.out$tot.withinss is the total within-cluster sum of squares, which we seek to minimize by performing K-means clustering. The individual within-cluster sum-of-squares are contained in the vector km.out$withinss.\nIt is strongly recommend to always run K-means clustering with a large value of nstart, such as 20 or 50, since otherwise an undesirable local optimum may be obtained.\nWhen performing K-means clustering, in addition to using multiple initial cluster assignments, it is also important to set a random seed using the set.seed() function. This way, the initial cluster assignments in Step 1 can be replicated, and the K-means output will be fully reproducible."

We illustrate these techniques on the NCI60 cancer cell line microarray data, which consists of 6,830 gene expression measurements on 64 cancer cell lines.\nThe question here is whether there are any genes that cluster by cell line.\n\nlibrary(ISLR2)\n\nWarning: package 'ISLR2' was built under R version 4.1.1\n\nnci.labs <- NCI60$labs\nnci.data <- NCI60$data\n\nEach cell line is labeled with a cancer type, given in nci.labs. We do not make use of the cancer types in performing PCA and clustering, as these are unsupervised techniques. But after performing PCA and clustering, we will check to see the extent to which these cancer types agree with the results of these unsupervised techniques.\nThe data has 64 rows and 6,830 columns.\n\ndim(nci.data)\n\n[1]   64 6830\n\n\nWe begin by examining the cancer types for the cell lines.\n\n# cancer type labels for the lines\nnci.labs[1:4]\n\n[1] \"CNS\"   \"CNS\"   \"CNS\"   \"RENAL\"\n\n# count of types\ntable(nci.labs) \n\nnci.labs\n     BREAST         CNS       COLON K562A-repro K562B-repro    LEUKEMIA \n          7           5           7           1           1           6 \nMCF7A-repro MCF7D-repro    MELANOMA       NSCLC     OVARIAN    PROSTATE \n          1           1           8           9           6           2 \n      RENAL     UNKNOWN \n          9           1 \n\n\n\n\nPCA NC160\nWe first perform PCA on the data after scaling the variables (genes) to have standard deviation one, although one might reasonably argue that it is better not to scale the genes (i.e. this is somewhat subjective).\n\npr.out <- prcomp(nci.data, scale = TRUE)\n\nWe now plot the first few principal component score vectors, in order to visualize the data. The observations (cell lines) corresponding to a given cancer type will be plotted in the same color, so that we can see to what extent the observations within a cancer type are similar to each other. We first create a simple function that assigns a distinct color to each element of a numeric vector. The function will be used to assign a color to each of the 64 cell lines, based on the cancer type to which it corresponds.\n\n\nrainbow() function\n\n# make function to set different colour palette for categories\nCols <- function(vec){\n  cols <- rainbow(length(unique(vec)))\n  return(cols[as.numeric(as.factor(vec))])\n  }\n\nNote that the rainbow() function takes as its argument a positive integer, and returns a vector containing that number of distinct colors. We now can plot the principal component score vectors.\n\npar(mfrow = c(1, 2))\n\n# visualization of clusters for PC1 and PC2\nplot(pr.out$x[ , 1:2], col = Cols(nci.labs), pch = 19, \n     xlab = \"Z1\", ylab = \"Z2\")\n\n# visualization of clusters for PC1 and PC3\nplot (pr.out$x[ , c(1, 3)], col = Cols (nci.labs), pch = 19, \n      xlab = \"Z1\", ylab = \"Z3\")\n\n\n\n\nOn the whole, cell lines corresponding to a single cancer type do tend to have similar values on the first few principal component score vectors. This indicates that cell lines from the same cancer type tend to have pretty similar gene expression levels.\nWe can obtain a summary of the proportion of variance explained (PVE) of the first few principal components using the summary() method for a prcomp object:\n\n# just slice out first 5 PCs to peek\nsummary(pr.out)$importance[, 1:5]\n\n                            PC1      PC2      PC3      PC4      PC5\nStandard deviation     27.85347 21.48136 19.82046 17.03256 15.97181\nProportion of Variance  0.11359  0.06756  0.05752  0.04248  0.03735\nCumulative Proportion   0.11359  0.18115  0.23867  0.28115  0.31850\n\n\nUsing the plot() function, we can also plot the variance explained by the first few principal components.\n\npar(mfrow=c(1,1))\nplot(pr.out, xlab = 'PC1 through PC10')\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFancier var plots\nNote that the height of each bar in the bar plot is given by squaring the corresponding element of pr.out$sdev. However, it is more informative to plot the PVE of each principal component (i.e. a scree plot) and the cumulative PVE of each principal component. This can be done with just a little work.\n\npve <- 100 * pr.out$sdev^2 / sum(pr.out$sdev^2)\npar(mfrow = c(1, 2))\nplot(pve, type = \"o\", \n     ylab = \"PVE\", xlab = \"Principal Component\", \n     pch = 16, col = \"red\")\nplot(cumsum(pve), type = \"o\", \n     ylab = \"Cumulative PVE\", xlab = \"Principal Component\", \n      pch = 16, col = \"blue\")\n\n\n\n\nWe see that together, the first seven principal components explain around 40% of the variance in the data. This is not a huge amount of the variance. However, looking at the scree plot, we see that while each of the first seven principal components explain a substantial amount of variance, there is a marked decrease in the variance explained by further principal components. That is, there is an elbow in the plot after approximately the seventh principal component. This suggests that there may be little benefit to examining more than seven or so principal components (though even examining seven principal components may be difficult in itself).\n\n\nclustering NC160\nWe now proceed to hierarchically cluster the cell lines in the NCI60 data, with the goal of finding out whether or not the observations cluster into distinct types of cancer. To begin, we standardize the variables to have mean zero and standard deviation one. As mentioned earlier, this step is optional and should be performed only if we want each gene to be on the same scale.\n\nsd.data <- scale(nci.data )\n\nWe now perform hierarchical clustering of the observations using complete, single, and average linkage. Euclidean distance is used as the dissimilarity measure.\n\npar(mfrow = c(1,3))\n\ndata.dist <- dist(sd.data)\nplot(hclust(data.dist), xlab = \"\", sub = \"\", ylab = \"\", \n     labels = nci.labs, main = \"Complete Linkage\")\n\nplot(hclust(data.dist, method = \"average\"),\n     labels = nci.labs, main = \"Average Linkage\", \n     xlab = \"\", sub = \"\", ylab = \"\")\n\nplot(hclust(data.dist, method = \"single\"), \n     labels = nci.labs , main = \"Single Linkage\", \n     xlab = \"\", sub = \"\", ylab = \"\")\n\n\n\n\nThese figures are not aesthetically pleasing, but we can still see that the three methods resulted in very different clustering.\nTypically, single linkage will tend to yield “trailing” clusters: very large clusters onto which individual observations attach one-by-one. On the other hand, complete and average linkage tend to yield more balanced, attractive clusters. For this reason, complete and average linkage are generally preferred to single linkage. Clearly cell lines within a single cancer type do tend to cluster together, although the clustering is not perfect. We will use complete linkage hierarchical clustering for the analysis that follows.\n\n\nCutting clusters\nWe can cut the dendrogram at the height that will yield a particular number of clusters, say four:\n\nhc.out <- hclust(dist(sd.data ))\nhc.clusters <- cutree (hc.out, 4)\ntable(hc.clusters , nci.labs )\n\n           nci.labs\nhc.clusters BREAST CNS COLON K562A-repro K562B-repro LEUKEMIA MCF7A-repro\n          1      2   3     2           0           0        0           0\n          2      3   2     0           0           0        0           0\n          3      0   0     0           1           1        6           0\n          4      2   0     5           0           0        0           1\n           nci.labs\nhc.clusters MCF7D-repro MELANOMA NSCLC OVARIAN PROSTATE RENAL UNKNOWN\n          1           0        8     8       6        2     8       1\n          2           0        0     1       0        0     1       0\n          3           0        0     0       0        0     0       0\n          4           1        0     0       0        0     0       0\n\n\nThere are some clear patterns. All the leukemia cell lines fall in cluster 3, while the breast cancer cell lines are spread out over three different clusters. We can plot the cut on the dendrogram that produces these four clusters:\n\npar(mfrow = c(1, 1))\nplot (hc.out, labels = nci.labs )\nabline(h = 139, col = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\nThe abline() function draws a straight line on top of any existing plot in R. The argument h = 139 plots a horizontal line at height 139 on the dendrogram; this is the height that results in four distinct clusters. It is easy to verify that the resulting clusters are the same as the ones we obtained using cutree(hc.out, 4).\nPrinting the output of hclust gives a useful brief summary of the object:\n\nhc.out\n\n\nCall:\nhclust(d = dist(sd.data))\n\nCluster method   : complete \nDistance         : euclidean \nNumber of objects: 64 \n\n\nK-means clustering and hierarchical clustering with the dendrogram cut to obtain the same number of clusters can yield very diﬀerent results. How do these NCI60 hierarchical clustering results compare to what we get if we perform K-means clustering with K = 4?\n\nset.seed (2)\nkm.out <- kmeans(sd.data, 4, nstart = 20)\nkm.clusters <- km.out$cluster\ntable(km.clusters, hc.clusters ) \n\n           hc.clusters\nkm.clusters  1  2  3  4\n          1 11  0  0  9\n          2 20  7  0  0\n          3  9  0  0  0\n          4  0  0  8  0\n\n\nWe see that the four clusters obtained using hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering are somewhat diﬀerent. Cluster 4 in K-means clustering is identical to cluster 3 in hierarchical clustering. However, the other clusters diﬀer: for instance, cluster 2 in K-means clustering contains a portion of the observations assigned to cluster 1 by hierarchical clustering, as well as all of the observations assigned to cluster 2 by hierarchical clustering.\nRather than performing hierarchical clustering on the entire data matrix, we can simply perform hierarchical clustering on the first few principal component score vectors, as follows:\n\nhc.out <- hclust(dist(pr.out$x[, 1:5]) )\nplot (hc.out, labels = nci.labs,\n      main = \"Hier. Clust. on First Five Score Vectors\")\n\n\n\ntable(cutree(hc.out, 4), nci.labs )\n\n   nci.labs\n    BREAST CNS COLON K562A-repro K562B-repro LEUKEMIA MCF7A-repro MCF7D-repro\n  1      0   2     7           0           0        2           0           0\n  2      5   3     0           0           0        0           0           0\n  3      0   0     0           1           1        4           0           0\n  4      2   0     0           0           0        0           1           1\n   nci.labs\n    MELANOMA NSCLC OVARIAN PROSTATE RENAL UNKNOWN\n  1        1     8       5        2     7       0\n  2        7     1       1        0     2       1\n  3        0     0       0        0     0       0\n  4        0     0       0        0     0       0\n\n\nNot surprisingly, these results are diﬀerent from the ones that we obtained when we performed hierarchical clustering on the full data set. Sometimes performing clustering on the first few principal component score vectors can give better results than performing clustering on the full data. In this situation, we might view the principal component step as one of “denoising” the data. We could also perform K-means clustering on the first few principal component score vectors rather than the full data set."
