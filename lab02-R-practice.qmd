title: "Lab 02 R practice"
---

The purpose of this lab is to practice some R basics that we will begin using right away.  If you are already proficient in R and need no practice, feel free to skip ahead to the Exercises to test yourself. 

## 1 Basic commands

### c()

R uses functions to perform operations. To run a function called `funcname`, we type `funcname(input1, input2)`, where the inputs (or arguments) `input1` and `input2` tell R how to run the function. A function can have any number of inputs. For example, to create a vector of numbers, we use the function `c()` (for concatenate). Any numbers inside the parentheses are joined together. The following command instructs R to join together the numbers 1, 3, 2, and 5, and to save them as a vector named `x`. When we type `x`, it gives us back the vector.

```{r}
x <- c(1,3,2,5)
x
```

### <-
We can also "save things" (i.e. assign values) using `=` rather than `<-`, though the "arrow" syntax is the standard style in `R`:


```{r}
x = c(1,6,2)
x
y = c(1,4,3) # why doesn't this "print out"?
```

### length()

Hitting the up arrow multiple times will display the previous commands, which can then be edited. This is useful since one often wishes to repeat a similar command. In addition, typing `?funcname` will always cause R to open a new help file window with additional information about the function `funcname.` We can tell R to add two sets of numbers together. It will then add the first number from `x` to the first number from y, and so on. However, x and y should be the same length. We can check their length using the `length()` function.
